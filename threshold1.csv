The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.  I was looking forward to trying out their fried oyster po' boy, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of oysters.  They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.  How are you just going to leave incorrect pricing in your menu (50 cents isn't a lot, but it's the principle)?\n\nWe were told by our waitress to try their fried chicken next time.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,FvTfqugdlzQSvFB1RAafNQ,"Logan Circle, also known as Logan Square, is a public park located in the center of the Logan Square neighborhood (yes, same name) in Philadelphia. It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia. Technically, the two listings should be merged, but the Yelp moderators disagree.",2019-08-04 12:29:33,4,5,0,genuine,0.1406573498964803,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,bI2WySNWJYzAudmArswvAA,"I had a great experience with Assurant. I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a ""new"" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an ""unrecovered equipment fee"" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).",2019-02-03 16:24:22,5,8,8,genuine,0.23286951144094,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g,"The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).",2021-02-12 20:10:07,3,10,3,fake,0.1656926406926406,0,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA,"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a ""KSOF"" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel. I recommend it.",2019-11-09 16:09:49,4,5,1,genuine,0.2553625541125541,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

xoZvMJPDW6Q9pDAXI0e_Ww,haeN53th7BKgUpkkpR9JtA,"If I want to escape from San Francisco and enter a time warp for a couple of days, I check in to the Peppermill Hotel in Reno, Nevada.  As far as Reno is concerned, this is as good as it gets, hence the 5-star rating.  However, if you are going to try to compare this experience to Las Vegas, it likely isn't going to measure up unless you restrict your comparison to being on-property at one place in Vegas.  I go to Vegas a dozen times a year, but I always take at least one trip to Reno to visit my beloved Peppermill.\n\nAll I can say is that the Peppermill in Reno provides me with something that even Las Vegas hotels do not, and that is a truly unique setting that enables me to feel completely isolated from the outside world...but in a good way.  It makes me feel like a kid again, playing in some big neon-clad fort that was created and added on to as needed over the years.  I love the casino, the diner, the little rooms with bars and video poker machines, the live music on the center stage, the pit bar, the sports book, the Fireside Lounge, and best of all, the newly built tower with fantastic updated rooms and suites.\n\nThe suite that I always stay in has a bar (complete with red velvet and undercounter red lighting) a living area with sofa, flat screen and a desk, and a powder bath.  The bedroom is large with cool lighting, a huge master bath, and televisions throughout.  The bathroom has a soaking jacuzzi tub, a glass enclosed shower, his and hers sinks, and a water closet.  For the price, this space provides a lot of bang for the buck, I guess.  You are in Reno, after all!  I usually wait for an offer in the mail to go so I am not paying full price.  I am never disappointed.\n\nThe property is not located downtown, so the only place you can really walk to is the Atlantis.  On the flip side, you don't have to deal with the crowds of downtown or the ""element"" that is more prevalent in that part of town.  I personally wouldn't stay downtown, but the Silver Legacy is nice to visit one day if you are looking for a change of scenery.\n\nI have not been to the pool, but it is heated and looks very nice.  I walk by everytime I go to the casino, so I can tell you that it is well-used.  The food (including room service) is good here.  They have plenty of options 24 hours a day, and the diner is a must at least once.  You can play Keno while you wait for your food if your palm is itching too much to take a break.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge is a really cool bar that I cannot leave out of this review.  It is unlike any other bar I have been to, with the exception of the one located in Vegas.  They have a firepit with a water feature and flat screen televisions blasting out music videos along with a number of other cool features.  They sometimes offer free appetizers, but I cannot tell you when because I am not sure.  I just happened across it a few times.\n\nI could go on and on about this place, but the bottom line is that it is fun.  It is my favorite place in Reno, as you may have guessed.  There is just something about this place.",2009-09-19 02:10:44,5,4,1,genuine,0.1984676736307171,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

Their Pizza is also really popular (i get the margehritta). You can order food to go which is great if you still have work to do in your room.\n\nFor drinks; its a brewery so of course they have wide selection of beer varietals. You can see some of the brew tanks inside the restaurant. They also house make their rootbeer, very tasty. They have a personal favorite on their wine list (ferari carano which you'll find throughout the El Dorado) and they have a full bar.\n\nI usually sit at the bar and most of the bar tenders are quick and friendly, Tim and Elijah have served me most of the times I've been and I feel completely comfortable sitting at the bar alone.

Its a great place to get your dance on without the club athmosphere.\n\nSince the restaraunt is at a casino there isn't a restroom inside, you have to walk just a short distance through some slot machines to get to it, not too bad exept the smell of ciggarette smoke is hard to avoid (not Brew Brothers fault though).",2011-02-21 18:40:06,5,0,0,genuine,0.2194709702062643,1,0,1,1,1.0,1,1

From NYC to DC, to Miami to L.A., to Boston to Chicago, I have not tried a better sangria than Modesto's. It's authentically-crafted with Brandy and simmered with sugar before cooling. It's pricey at $24/pitcher, but worth the praise you'll receive for suggesting it as well as the laughs that will soon ensue.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with the food.

Lobster crepes (stuffed with equally massive amounts of lobster), truly rich lobster bisque, moist tender rack of lamb, and obscenely intense veal tenderloin with exotic mushroom sauce (a special) were equally brilliant examples.\nMy only observation and minor nit about the food was that the meat was not precisely cooked - all the smaller medium-rare items were solidly medium, while the larger filet mignon, ordered medium, came out medium-rare.  But all were delectable, and very tender.\n\nDesserts were equally brilliant, from the Belgian dark chocolate mousse to the Austrian cheese strudel.\n\nThe wine list is reasonably large and well selected, especially considering the location, though the markup is enormous.  Unfortunately, due to the exorbitant licensing fees charged by Pennsylvania, this is more or less unavoidable, and with a careful search (and sufficient knowledge) reasonable value items can be found.\n\nService was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable (though the average wine knowledge of the servers isn't large).\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic meal in an out-of-the-way, rusticly romantic environment, look no further.\n\nThey also have a B&B with quite reasonably priced rooms on site.",2007-10-22 02:13:55,5,4,0,genuine,0.1949546485260771,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

I was greeted by the host and seated immediately.  My waitress was on top of things and the food came out on time an fresh.\n\nFood - I had the Tomato & Feta Bruschetta w/Baked Tortilla for an appetizer....it was awesome!  I highly recommend it.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  For an entree, I had the cheeseburger....I would have tried something else, but I really wanted to try the bruschetta appetizer and I didn't think I could eat that and an entree by myself.  The burger was excellent....just the right size, not too large and not too small.  The fries were steak-cut fries and cooked perfectly....not too hard/soft.\n\nAtmosphere - I was here in the Spring time and the weather was awesome....so I ate outside on the patio.  I'm glad I did....it was very relaxing.\n\nWine - The wine selection was decent....not great, but decent.  I had a glass of the Malbec....don't remember what the vineyard was though.\n\nWhile I was dining....there were no more than 5 tables occupied in the joint.

5cVgAicAhCTSrKzsKDuTdw,5gUZ-DSFUg-jxeaLPfDPvw,"4 stars. The Dish is a small restaurant tucked away inside a modern wine and cheese shop called the Rum Runner. Although we had the address, it took us a while because we were looking for a big sign that read ""The Dish"".\n\nThe setting is modern, intimate and may even feel a bit pretentious. Patron dress ranged from casual to dressy, but all pretty tidy. The ambience is best for couples, the tables are small, much like round bar tables where one might stand, although there are high stools available. The largest table I spotted could accommodate a party of four, rubbing elbows. Since we had kids in tow after a long day out, we decided that it would be more comfortable for us to buy take-out.\n\nThe food was very tasty, but the portions were not huge. We ordered a chicken dish, a pork dish, but our hands-down favorite were the steamed mussels, which not only tasted heavenly, but were also a phenomenal value, compared to other menu items. What puzzled me was that our waiter was a bit tentative about our take-out order, not being sure if our mussels could be made for take-out since it would be ""brothy"". Made me wonder if no one else had ordered take-out before. (""Things that make you go ""hmm..."") Bottom line was that they did have good take-out containers and none of the savory broth was spilled. Just didn't expect ""take-out"" that to be an issue at an establishment like this.\n\nThe prices were on the high side, but may be rationalized by the quality of the food. The ""jumbo shrimp with serrano ham"" was tasty but the size of the portion (and the shrimp) was a bit disappointing. Other than that, everything qualifies for ""thumbs up"". The complimentary bread was also very good.\n\nThe wine and cheese section carried a wide variety of wines and spirits. Dining patrons may order wine from the restaurant or pick a bottle from the wine shop but pay corkage. The cheese deli was also very diverse. We bought some very special and delicious fig tapenade, which was a new recipe from one of their chefs.\n\nVerdict: best for a romantic night on the town and if money were no object. Wasn't looking for oysters, but the mussels are a must-have.",2008-01-03 07:52:12,4,2,0,genuine,0.171042291042291,1,0,1,1,1.0,1,1

I should also note that I frequent some of the better Thai establishments around LA county so my review is probably bias.\n\nMeun Fan Thai simply fell on ""ok"" status for me. My girlfriend and I went here to have lunch one weekend and we were really disappointed by the limited menu offerings and the quality of the food after we had ordered. Sure this place is nice and clean, but just because you have a gold elephant on the wall, it doesn't make your restaurant legit Thai.\nOne of the first things that I noticed about the menu was the lack of noodle soups. Sure there are hot pot and tom yum but where's the boat noodle? That should be a simple thing to have on the menu and is usually a staple item on just about any Thai menu.\nMy girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai and while the color and flavor were present, the noodles were a shame. They were more pho noodle than typical rice stick noodle that pad thai usually is made with. This made it more soggy and not as good to eat.\nMy order of curry noodle had a brick of noodles sitting in curry sauce.  It was sad. How does one overcook a brick of pre-prepped noodles?\n\nAnyway, needless to say, 10$ per dish was not pleasing.

More often than not, it was the last stop on the crawl home from the bars.  Drinks are consistently strong, but pricey (I'm talking $8 - $10 a drink for a low range vodka and soda water).  They have a really lengthy martini list that is lots of fun if you're in an adventurous mood.  The service is friendly, and I love the ambiance - small, quaint, and cozy, white lights on the outside...Gypsy always looks warm and inviting.  \n\nThey sometimes have live music, a huge plus.  Most recently, there was a great cover band duo, which played everything from Lady Antebellum to Lady Gaga.  \n\nThe food - really tasty.  I especially love the lobster mac 'n cheese, it's amazing.  If you've ever eaten at Stella Blu, it's the same menu (same owners).  Gypsy would totally earn 5 stars in my book if it weren't for their prices...they are fairly steep.

I don't care what anyone says about the Steven Starr restaurants.  I've been to lots of different places, but this still always remains my favorite.  Village Whiskey is the best burger I've EVER had, no doubt.  Also some of the best alcohol-forward, ""Prohibition"" style cocktails I've ever had.  Not to mention their whiskey list is MILES long.  \n\nTrust me on this - order a Village burger, add the aged cheddar and an egg.  Yes, an egg - this is the crucial ingredient.  I can't speak for the fois gras - I don't eat it.  Anyway, do the above, and order it cooked M...it will be pink and juicy and heavenly.

Village Whiskey is SMALL though, really not much seating, and they don't take reservations.  So basically, it gets super packed.  Be prepared to wait, or venture in during non-peak hours.

IpLRJY4CP3fXtlEd8Y4GFQ,l77oQneNdxj4IUhusXqWGA,"I'm going to try to be as gentle as I can with this review.  I went to Total Serenity yesterday for a massage, and it was a horrific experience.  I'm trying to be gentle, because the woman who took care of me seemed to be somewhat nice. However, she has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE with professional massage. I get better backrubs from my 7 year old niece.\n\nI would have to agree with one of the other people who posted before me who said that the masseuse had no technique, just straight up and down rubs.  At first, I thought this was just her way of prepping or warming up my muscles. I kept thinking to myself,""Okay, NOW the real massage will begin!!"" LOL. Well, after saying that about 20-30 times, I knew this woman didn't know the first thing about a REAL massage. This made me mad, because my back and neck were full of stress knots.\n\nWell, the worst was yet to come.  She moved on to my legs and started doing some crazy technique that made me want to yell out in pain!!!  I get massages fairly often at other places, so I'm pretty sure she was doing it WRONG. Every person who ever massaged my calves and thighs did it in a relaxing way to get the kinks out.\n\nOn top of that, I think this woman had a BUTT FETISH!!!  LOL. I'm laughing right now, but I wasn't laughing yesterday.  As she massaged my thighs, she made sure to end each stroke with a handful of my butt.Each time, she stroked it slow and sensually, almost like she thought it was turning me on!  EWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't want that kind of massage from a woman!!!  It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage.

Usually not.\n\nSo in spite of all this, what is the appeal? Simply put Angry Chair makes some of the best beers in the country. Whether you're looking for a mouth puckering sour or a dense pastry stout, Angry Chair can and does knock it out of the park. Producing some of the most flavorful and unique barrel-aged beers I've ever tried, Angry Chair sets the beer game bar high.

Another winner, Barrel Aged Popinski with Peanut Butter & Marshmallow tastes like a fluffernutter. A bottle we got lucky enough to enough to happen upon by pure happenstance, Bourbon Barrel Dave's Barleywine, had an excellent malt backbone and tasted like toffee.\n\nThe taproom itself is trendy and industrial, with cool metal bone seats that are more decorative than comfortable. Funky art scattered about, and of course the many references to ""angry"" chairs make for a laid back atmosphere. While by no means a spots bar, they do have a couple of televisions as well should you want to watch the game with a cold brew.

A conference center and hotel, Gaylord Opryland offers ample walking paths, multiple restaurants, a river boat ride, a salon and spa, and now a water park as well. It is quite the labyrinth and is easy to get lost despite the signposts peppered throughout, although this often makes for the best exploration. While the hotel isn't located in the heart of downtown Nashville, it isn't a terribly far drive either.\n\nTaking a stroll through the atriums is like being in a tropical oasis. There are multiple waterfalls, streams, and lush foliage. While I have no idea what any of it has to do with Nashville itself or its history, it is quite lovely. The strategically placed oversized guitars feel a bit out of place, and yet seem more authentic to the local flavor. Compared to Gaylord Palms in Orlando which actually has decor centered around Florida (Evergaldes, Key West, and Saint Augustine), I felt less of the connection to the city here. However, I can't deny that the hotel is still quite picturesque. Visit around Christmas, and the entire hotel is bedecked in holly and strings of twinkling lights as well.\n\nLike any major hotel, Gaylord Opryland  comes with its pros and cons. The parking is high on my annoyance list, because although it is ample, it is pretty steep extra on top of the cost of your actual room. Whether you are a short term visitor, or a hotel guest, expect to pay around $32 a day. Also the restaurants are plentiful (think Italian, Mexican, sushi, and a grill), but none are particularly great. They do have Starbucks on premises if you are short on time, but walk or drive across the street to Nashville Coffees for a better selection and more interesting options.\n\nIf you are staying on business or at the hotel for a conference, the conference center is massive and quite convenient. There is more than enough space for an exhibition hall and smaller rooms for more intimate talks. WiFi is available throughout the area if you need to sneak away to get work done on your laptop. Speaking of the WiFi, you can also connect throughout the grounds or in the hotel rooms, and they have a direct wired connection if you need something faster, which makes a better choice if you need to connect to a VPN or are on a call.\n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable, although certainly some sections are better than others. For example, a room in Magnolia may have you in a fairly basic look (your standard outdated hotel) and a view of a courtyard/pool, whereas in Delta the rooms seem to be a bit more modern, and if you're lucky you can get a view of one of the domed areas, which makes for great people watching.\n\nWorth visiting at least once, even if you aren't a hotel guest!

Kellie even went out of her way to replace the feta cheese with some additional vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. Both were excellent, reasonably priced at $6.00-$7.00 and you could taste the love embedded in each.

There evidently was a dispute over what the repair center and what my insurance company were supposed to do, and it does appear that my insurance company bears some responsibility.  My primary concern is that when I spoke directly with the person at reception about having the repairs done, she neglected to tell me that there was a problem and that she needed additional information. Instead she told me everything was all set. I think she was overwhelmed and just wanted to move on to the next waiting person.  A week later, after having been told the car was completely repaired, I went to pick it up to find only half the work done - and, had to find this out myself.  No one at the repair service told me that they only did one part of the repair.  Poor, expensive, assembly-line service is what you will get at this place.\n\nReview Update:\nAs Shawn at Don Brown mentioned, after posting this review, I was immediately contacted by Pam in Customer Service.

They came out hours before the game and sat in the rain til it started. We watched the Phillies vs the Washington Nationals on Monday, May 21st. It was funny routing for the Nationals the day before. We arrived over two hours early and they had already opened up a limited section of the park. We got a drink at Harry The K's the restaurant in left field named after Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas. You can sit and watch the full game there as long as you keep buying. We watched the Phillies batting practice and walked around the park as it opened.

It also wouldn't be Philly without a replica Liberty Bell.  It ""rings"" and lights up after Philly home runs and wins. Unfortunately, we didn't see either. The Nats won. Another Philadelphia quirk is that their bullpens are in the outfield amongst the fans. When they first opened in 2004 the Phillies bullpen was closest to the fans and after Philly fans booed their own pitchers (these are the same fans that booed Santa Claus) they switched to have the visitors section closer for heckling.\n\nThe mascot always needs mentioning.

We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: ""What was her name?  She sounded hot.""\n  \nMe: ""Paige.""\n\nViper: ""Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?""\n\nMe: ""Good point.  At least we have that going for us.""\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",2012-01-03 19:26:16,4,3,6,genuine,0.2297974537037036,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

Located in Mid-City, Li'l Dizzy's is a cozy diner serving up an all you can eat breakfast/lunch consisting of fried chicken, trout, shrimp creole, rice & beans, grits, gumbo, omelettes made to order, fruit, and maybe a few other items as well.  It was all pretty standard until I reached the gumbo.  \n\nLi'l Dizzy's gumbo is heavenly.  They don't hold back on either the sausage or the seafood as you have generous cuts of andouille sausage and crab legs in the wonderfully thick dark brown soup.  They got the flavor so perfect I felt no need to add any tabasco to my order.  I'd definitely come back here for the gumbo.  \n\nOverall, you have plenty of options for breakfast/lunch in this city, and Li'l Dizzy's is a good one if you are in Mid-City.

Unfortunately, unless you request a bottle to be opened freshly for your glass, you risk getting a refrigerated glass of red.\nThe warm, soft, herbed focacia and infused olive oil brought to the table is delicious. We started off with the cheese and fruit platter which had nice presentation, was generous and came with even more yummy, warmed breads pita & crostini was the winner of our experience. \nWe settled on one of the specials which was a plate full of sea food accompanied by rice and roasted vegetables, since we wanted to share it we added a sirloin to the platter. \nThe wine, cheese and easy going atmosphere we were both enjoying, but the main course we found to be a huge disappointment. There was nothing special about the rice i mean it was just rice, the shrimp were over cooked, the ahi tuna was! lets put it this way we didn't eat it, the salmon was cooked perfectly, as well as the large diver scallop, the large stuffed oyster had a strange earthy grittiness and flavor to it,the seasonings were nothing special your straight forward salt and pepper,the platter was very much like the basic fair you get at your average seafood place on Cape Cod,we were fortunately already full from the breads and cheese platter and made due with the salmon and scallop. \nLastly I will say the place was very accommodating to special requests made by the guest and our server was the other highlight of the experience. \nShe was gracious, polite and totally let us enjoy ourselves without being all over us or rushing us. \nI wish I could remember her name, because she was really great.

I was lucky - I know an insider. So, we didn't have to wait TOO long for a table. But I heard they don't normally take reservations and the wait is sometimes a bit long. We also had a chance to try a pretty good variety of dishes.\n\nDrinks: I don't drink whiskey, but my boyfriend and his friend both loved a tasting of 3 and after-dinner one, too. I had two different cocktails: Ginger Rogers (and I'm not even a huge gin fan) and a De Rigueur. Both lovely and tasty! Yes, girly.\n\nApps: I don't do oysters, but the other couple with us enjoyed 2 of each. I had the pickled truffle lemon artichokes, and I was in heaven. Whipped ricotta to spread on your toast? Great idea! This is the best artichoke concoction I've ever tasted. Best. The pickled Herb Cherry Tomatoes were yummy, too, though I've had a lot of great cherry tomatoes lately. Popcorn shrimp were tasty, but the sauce was what really impressed me. As did the mustard and cheese sauce for the soft pretzels. The condiments topped the pretzels, for me. That cheese!\n\nDinner: Burger - medium, cheddar, bacon, awesome. 2 can split it. The bbq Pork looked wonderful, too, and when I looked at my friends' plates, they were clean. It was gone in, like, 1 1/2 minutes.\n\nDessert: We got to try all three desserts. The Irish Car Bomb was good, kind of like a wet cake, though. The Shortcake was good, with a mix of strawberry/rhubarb, though you couldn't taste much rhubarb in it. On the side of that was a buttermilk sorbet which really impressed me. The winner of best dessert, though, is the 'Nutter Shake. I've never had such a milkshake - so many flavors, thick, and with a bite-sized blondie on the side. Blondies melt me.\n\nI would give it 5 stars, if it weren't so pricey.\n\nThe decor is outstanding, as all of Jose's places are. I love a great-looking old-timey-looking bar. Very classy.

The lighting is always dim and the music is always good but not too loud so I can still hear the person across the table.  This place is both funky and classy, a place where almost anyone would feel comfortable.\n\nDrink wise, there is a fantastic selection.  This is important since some of my friends don't drink, but that's not a problem because Pravda has coffee which my non-drinking friends love.  Since the weather has been cold, I've been enjoying the hot toddys on a regular basis.  If you are interested in trying absinthe they've got it.  If you're looking for a mixed drink, they have a nice selection of vodka and other liquor.  They also have a nice selection of wine around $6 a glass, I have had a couple of the reds and they were worth it.  If you're looking for a beer, they have a nice selection of beers.

0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,tkweJH1iRDSUG5stKf7krQ,"I've long admired the Hotel Mazarin for its picturesque courtyard because I'm often in the adjoining wine bar, the exquisite Patrick's Bar Vin. I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as ""charm""  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar. Plus it's just nicer all around than other FQ hotels in this price range.",2015-04-03 17:12:46,3,11,2,fake,0.1362555851110067,0,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

Where there were once specific streets or neighborhoods that were known to be great for vintage shopping in any given city, that's no longer the case in cities like New Orleans or New York. I look at the 50+ dresses that are in my closet, mainly from the 20s through the early 60s. It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers). What was once a fine silk frock is now reduced to spiderweb thread-bare on the seams, shoulders and anywhere there's the slightest bit of friction. Evil moths have attacked cashmere sweaters (they sure do have good taste, as they leave alone the cheap cotton numbers) leaving them beyond repair.\n\nBut I don't mean to depress you. There's Blue Dream, restoring my faith in vintage. I looked through well-kept racks of dresses, men's shirts, jeans and accessories and was quite impressed.

New Orleans now has a fabulous Tiki bar, with just the right dark Polynesian atmosphere that's straight outta Trader Vics circa 1965. My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved caçaca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues.

Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.\n\nMore fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes. Apparently there's a tale of him drinking one too many zombies at Don the Beachcomber and then killed a pedestrian with his car. Bad Howie!! I hope it's not true.

Besides, with people coming in from all over at all times *and* it being that it's in a hotel, next year it would be nice to see extended check-in times.\n\nThat aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my lost week, I mean, incredibly fun-filled week at TOTC. From the volunteer staff who checked you in at each event and seminar (all of them incredibly nice) to the tasting rooms to the hotels and other types of event venues, all I can say is that I was left thoroughly impressed. There was just so much going on, it's impossible to catch everything. I paced myself rather well (time for a pat on the back). \n\nAnd that L'agniappe Lounge. WOW!!! This room, I believe, is only for media and other sponsors, but holy crap. All of the brands and sponsors left swag, product and other fun materials (favorite had to be the moleskine notebooks thanks to Tanqueray or Hennessey-- it's tastefully embossed into the cover). OH!! And the bottles of shrubs and bitters!!!! I also now have an entire bar of tiny bottles (there were regular bottles, too, but I didn't take any due to not wanting to carry them around). Boozers, you will feel like a kid in a candy shop in that room! Incredible. \n\nMy favorite events were Better with Age and the Absolut bash (I mean... they had SNOW pumped into the room!). The Diageo Happy Hour was fun because of the people I was with, however the food left a lot to be desired (do not bring a bread bowl around to hundreds of people to dip their hands into. Whose idea was that??)\n... not to mention that although there were master mixologists at the bars, they had to make due with the ingredients that were given to them (kind of like the ""Chopped"" for bartenders). I definitely preferred the vodka cocktails to any others.\n\nWhile the booze flowed freely, my tip to attendees is to make sure and pack some energy bars because this event is not about food, so don't expect any. Plan accordingly! Also next year, I plan to stay in a hotel so I can stumble to/from events (and leave all the goodies I pick up along the way in my room). \n\nNote: I did not attend any of the Spirited Dinners this year.",2012-08-23 16:25:08,5,15,10,genuine,0.1609190385334122,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

I don't know about you, but it's rare to be utterly disappointed after that. Or, perhaps you just don't let yourself be. The importance of good reception should not be overlooked!\n\nWith that in mind, I bring you my review of Ricardo's Italian Cafe. I had been drinking coffee all morning at the fabulous Park Avenue Coffee next door, but alas, a low fat blueberry muffin did not keep me sated for more than 3 hours, so come lunchtime, I checked Yelp and was overjoyed to see an Italian restaurant is located right next door. Especially because St. Louis is known to have some damn good Italian American food!\n\nI was seated by window without even asking. Bonus points again for first impressions here! The menu has a good amount of pasta dishes, but I was dazzled by the eggplant parmesan, as is typical for me. It's offered both as a small plate and as an entree (don't quote me on this, but I believe the full size portion is offered on a lunch special).\n\nMolto sadness: apparently due to the freeze in Mexico, there are no eggplants to be had, as I was told by the waitress. Soooo, if you were hoping to get locally sourced vegetables, well it ain't happening here (I know, I know... eggplant isn't in season in MO right now). I instead ordered the minestrone and penne tossed with garlic, oil and vegetables.\n\nThe Minestrone... I hate to say this, when I wanted to like a place so much (yes, that warm greeting really does go a long way), but it is possibly the worst I've ever had. I hate likening anything in a restaurant to store bought, but this is the stuff that Campbell's Alphabet soup is made of. Inexcusable in an Italian restaurant.\n\nOn to the main course: let's say it made up for the soup in droves. I quite possible inhaled this dish! Delicious pasta, crisp broccoli, fresh mushrooms with just the right amount of olive oil and garlic. Perfection.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant lends itself well to both a business lunch or a romantic dinner. There are two cozy dining rooms (you enter through the bar) and while it won't be winning any design awards, it's a familiar kind of scene that conjures up Italian American bistros across the US and I like this sort of thing. It's not garish with pink lighting and marble busts like Anthony's in Kansas City, and several notches above my beloved Milo's here in Saint Louis. \n\nI do think I'd return to Ricardo's when in the neighborhood. I judge most Italian American places by their marinara sauce, which I didn't get to try here. Next time!

My friend and I stopped in first to Maurepas for their sick grits that are as buttery as all fuck, but other than that, they didn't really have any brunch food, so we headed for our second brunch at Suis Generis. Seriously. Two brunches? Talk about eyes being bigger than our stomachs. A quick perusal of the menu revealed a stuffed Atlanta Falcon for dinner (brilliant!

Neruda would never be prone to such cliché!)\n\nSo, let's just say that the overwhelming vibe of Il Posto is that of a rustic Italian cafe. Not unlike the cafe in the movie Il Postino. You may be overcome by the desire to just order shot after shot of espresso, but the sight and smells of the cafe's offerings will convince you to do otherwise.\n\nI admit I'm not at all a fan of half service.

It's Louisiana-owned\n2. They have Cajun hot nuts\n3. Related to the above, they have an array of other NOLA specialty items (tourists, buy your foodie souvenirs here rather than the FQ)\n4. Kick ass olive bar (but just about as pricey as WF's)\n5. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n6. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n7. Phenomenal wine/beer selection (see my note about hard liquor below).\n\nThere is no hydrophonic rooftop garden at this one, but that's OK. What they do have that the CBD Rouses doesn't have is a larger and easier to navigate produce section. That said, the organics are still seriously lacking. And what's with the tomatoes imported from Mexico? The store is bigger and there is less of that clusterfuck feeling that you'd expect in any supermarket smack dab in the middle of downtown. \n\nThe popcorn selection is bliss, by the way. An entire section of the snack aisle and I found those black and red popcorn types that promise all kinds of antioxidant benefits. I don't really care, though. I just wanted to buy black popcorn.\n\nOn a distressing note, I cannot believe there is an entire subcategory of Hot Pockets, as noted on the aisle sign (Ie the head category is Frozen and then below it, they have subcategories of normal stuff like pizza, vegetables, fruit etc.) I mean, Hot Pockets are a brand, not a type of food. Actually calling Hot Pockets ""food"" is also a stretch. Sorry, that's just my hatred of convenience foods shining through and has nothing to do with my star rating. But please, for the love of your body: Stop your Hot Pocket habit.\n\nOne thing that is really hella lame: what's with the separate counter for hard liquor?

The original was dark and red, where the new is drenched in lighter hues, but it's colorless as far as I can tell.

As in, it's generally something I do because I *have* to, not because I *want* to (I mean, living in a city where 10 months out of the year it's warm means for maximum foot exposure. And I'm prone to peelin' heels). What I appreciate here is that you have the mini pedi option (ie, they do away with the unbearable-to me-foot massage and it's about 10 minutes quicker), and instead of overbearing ""massage chairs"" (sorry, more like torture devices), there's a comfy cushioned bench that runs along the wall. \n\nSo, there goes the pedi phobia.\n\nOther stuff:\n-a glass of red, white or Champagne offered upon arrival (and what's more, it's good! We're not talking cheap box stuff, but bottles from local purveyors, Keife & Co. Just one of the little extras that sets Buff apart from the competition)\n-fabulous color selection in both regular polish and gel\n-competitive prices with other salons in town, while at the same time offering a superior environment and services\n-no technicians making fun of you to their coworkers in other languages (c'mon, you know they do)\n-on that note, very nice technicians that are easy to talk to\n\nand most importantly: Kim gave me the very best gel manicure I've received, possibly ever. It was evenly painted, did not at all peel off (so common when you have tiny nail beds like I do, not to mention super short nails) and I didn't see my nasty jagged cuticles again for at least a week. \n\nOh, and can I just mention how in love I am with the ORIGINAL tile floor?

It's a smaller, more boutiquey, more *worldly* Bed Bath and Beyond. And the grocery section, while small, is just so much cheaper than Whole Foods. So sue me. I cannot resist WOMA's charms.\n\nI used to live quite close to one in KC and I was there an average of 2 times per week, picking up wine, candles, incense, seasoning, imported snacks, storage baskets, towels, outdoor lighting, bath products, hazelnut biscotti and more. Not to mention wickedly discounted Halloween decorations on November 1st. \n\nIt just has all of my favorite things in one store.

I don't think I'll be the same again after this. Luckily I exhibit a fair degree of self control. The cruelest irony that ice cream season coincides with swimsuit season. WHATEV, right?\n\nSo, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. Want some cockamamie never-hear-of-before flavors (Green Fairy, anyone?) They've got that here. Die hard traditionalist? They've got you covered (anything from vanilla to butter pecan). Diabetic? There's both an ice cream and a special sundae for you. Can't have dairy? While I didn't see any soy or nut ice creams, they do have sorbet. On a diet? Well, then, I'm afraid you're SOL. There's a kiddie cup, but it's for the kids only. Their small cup *probably* won't kill you too much, though.\n\nFirst visit had me sampling my friend's choice: red velvet cake. While not a fan of red velvet cake, I can't deny this ice cream brings it to a whole new level. Instead of being merely red velvet flavored ice cream, it's got bits of red velvet cake throughout. Scream-worthy, right?\n\nSecond visit, I came with a mission: to try four flavors via the 4 scoop sample (you get 4 small scoops for $4. A bargain, no?) My choices: sweet corn with raspberry and black peppercorn, Green Fairy, butterscotch butter pecan, and blueberry pie, my favorites being the latter two, however I wouldn't throw the other two out of bed... I mean the bowl. Green Fairy wins the creative award because I'd never think to have absinthe-flavored ice cream! It also has bittersweet chocolate and orange peels, which make for a really tasty, unique concoction. My only issue is that I'm not a fan of chocolate bits in ice cream, otherwise, I'd be all over this. Butterscotch butter pecan brings a bit of a more intense, grown up twist to an old timey classic (I had to wonder if there's booze in it). Blueberry pie... sigh. Just perfect. I need a moment alone with it. Perhaps even a year. The sweet corn is a bit too overpowered by the peppercorns and could stand to have more raspberry, in my opinion. That's the *only* criticism I'd have. With all those flavor choices, who cares? Oh and feel free to sample if you're on the fence (but obey the sign: don't be a sample hog).\n\nThe best thing about this ice cream is that it's not crazy sweet. I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Take the salted caramel, for example (I know you will). I tried my friend's and was quite taken with it. I love the idea of salted caramel but I've had that flavor before at other places and found it sickeningly sweet- not at all salty. Creole Creamery has somehow managed to achieve just the right balance of flavor.\n\nAnd so, I bid Creole Creamery farewell... meaning in this review.

Comfy bed, delicious bath products, space for dancing... What a unique space! I didn't indulge, but appreciated the variety at the mini bar (nice prices too. What?!)

Rather than old timey Southern style, which is kind of the NOLA hotel thing traditionally, the Ace is designed in the style of a wealthy artist, movie mogul or musician's mansion in the late 1930s... perhaps in Manhattan or Havana. I know, I know. I may not be making sense. I wasn't around in the 1930s (but I kind of wish I was).

Then we each got to make beautiful, dark, cajun roux (something I've never been able to do right before!), and the eight of us melded into a cooking machine, finishing our chicken and andouille gumbo and shrimp creole.  Robin gave us lots of tips on how to freeze the dishes at different points to speed things up at home as well.\n\nFinally it was time to chow down (about 2:30 p.m. or so) - and what do you know, we can cook, baby!

C0hNXqJZJuly7et8sSvSAQ,KDznD2lvCPczTpmJH3t8QQ,"Casual Dining  3/11/2008\n\nI have to agree with Joan S.' review.  Despite the unique ambience and the beautiful surroundings, Cold Spring Tavern, in terms of food, is overrated.  \n\nAs for the restaurant itself, it's located off of the 154 freeway in one of the most least expected areas.  Surrounded by plenty of trees and a spring, the tavern is definitely worth visiting just for the scenery.  There are several rooms to sit in and we decided to occupy the room with the fireplace.  Unfortunately, they had just put out the fire and the room was filled with the smell of smoke.  In one corner of the room was a scythe that felt out of place and beside the table that we sat in was the fur of a bobcat hanging on the wall, with the head still in tact.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, I had somewhat high expectations for my Bar-B-Q Venison Sausage Burger ($10.00) with a potato salad on the side.  The sausage patty, made from deer, was overcooked but the red onions were perfectly tender.  The overall experience wasn't satisfying, and the barbecue sauce did not work well with the sausage patty either.  In addition, the potato salad tasted too 'rich,' the yolk from the egg and the onions as well, were overwhelming.  \n\nThe next order was a bit more conservative, the Cold Spring Chili Burger ($9.25), and it didn't fair any better on the grill.  The meat was dry, and the chili was too beany; it felt more like a bean burger.  The bread from the burger bun was grilled appropriately however, and I couldn't find any complaints.  It was crispy where I wanted it to be and paired better with the chili.  As to what everyone else suggested, maybe next time I should go with the tri-tip sandwich.\n\nHaving heard so many good responses to this place, we decided on a dessert and it may have been the best part of the meal, Granny Smith Apple Cobbler ($5.95), not the one you'd find from the frozen food section, mind you.  Served hot, it didn't look anything like a pie at all, almost reminiscent of bread pudding.  It was littered with pecans, 3 small scoops of whip cream, and puff pastry. There was also a hint of lemon, as a surprise.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/20  If you're a big fan of Chumash Casino, head down the 154 and don't be afraid to take a peek.  Then pick up some fudge at Solvang, if you have room left in your stomach.  But be prepared to find out that just because a place is authentic, doesn't necessarily mean the food comes out better.",2008-03-12 04:08:31,3,4,2,fake,0.1859823848238482,0,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

The Barbeque and The Special with a few substitutions.  No garlic on The Barbeque and no onions and sausage on The Special (which makes it our standard so that we could get a god comparison between all the pizza places).\n\nThe Barbeque was Dear Hubby's favorite.  It had a nice kick to it and to me it tasted like it had a bit of an Asian influence on it, maybe in the sauce.\n\nThe Special was very good.  The crust here is nice.  Thin, crispy and yet tender.  We took the leftovers home and these may have warmed up better than any other leftover pizza we've ever had.\n\nWe'll definitely be going back for more.",2010-04-25 19:55:36,4,0,0,genuine,0.2472767857142857,1,0,0,1,1.0,1,1

It's similar but different so put those thoughts aside and come enjoy some of the best food in town.  Not fancy but good.\n\nI asked a friend about it before going because I had visited their website and was quite disappointed with what I saw for the most part.  She informed me the trick was not to order off the menu (except the schnitzel.  I also heard rave reviews for the cabbage rolls.\n\nOn the day we went, Sevala, the owner and chef, got to about the second daily special, cabbage rolls and I stopped her.  That was all I needed to hear.  My friend ordered the jagerschnitzel.  While neither was like what I've had in German restaurants, they were both very good.  I LOVED the cabbage rolls.  Absolutely the best I have ever had.  And the simple salad and freshly grilled pita were a perfect accompaniment.  If anything was disappointing, it was the pasta, which was macaroni that day, that was served with the schnitzle.  Even though we were full, we ended our meal by splitting a nutella filled crepe that was great.\n\nThis past week I returned for lunch by myself.  There was a couple at one table and two couples at another table.  Everyone was sharing stories.  One of the older gentlemen was either from Bosnia or of Bosnian descent and he was raving how the food was like he grew up with.\n\nThis time I got the rouladen.  Very similar to German rouladen except the sauce/gravy.  And very good.  The dish consisted of two rouladen with a serving of mashed potatoes, red cabbage, salad and pita.  Very ample serving.  I couldn't eat it but I had to have a piece of the homemade apple struedel becasue the older gentleman was talking about how he hadn't had any like that since his mother (?) made it.\n\nThe one couple comes to Cafe Bosna twice a week for lunch and brings containers because Sevala fixes them meals to take home and warm up.  They said that Sevala prepares everything with love and I think that sums it up perfectly.  She loves what she's doing and she wants to take care of her customers like they are family.  She even sat down and started talking with us, sharing her story even pulling out pictures of her first grandchild that was born last month.  \n\nSevala cooks on a regular residental stove and small commerical grill.  Everything is prepared fresh as you order it and always by Sevala.  While she does have some help from time to time, it's usually just her bustling around cooking, serving, greeting, and making everyone feel welcome.  While the decor is nothing special and the location not the best, the good food and feeling of friendship and family make this one of my most favorite places in Nashville.",2010-02-07 03:24:54,5,9,0,genuine,0.2789800742992233,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

We were already on a sugar/carb overload so we got two things each and now we wish we had gotten more.  This is another place that is worth the drive to get to!

Like Wild Noodles that used to be over off Cool Springs Blvd., I really want to like the noodle places but they just aren't like the noodle houses that we have eaten in when we travel.\n\nOn first try I had the steak stroganoff.  The beef was fairly tasty but the noodles were just off as was the sauce.  It had a strange sort of tang to it.  The other person in my party ordered the Pesto Cavatappi.  It looked nothing like the picture on the menu that was bright spring green from pesto.  You could barely see the tiny green flecks and lacked much pesto flavor.  And the cavatappi was dry, not enough sauce and again, a strange texture.  I think the noodles are precooked or something and it just shows in these dishes.\n\nWe had noticed that most of the people around us on the first visit had all ordered the Asian noodle dishes.  They are on to something.  Then I got a coupon for a free bowl complete with the meat.  So I got the Japanese Pan Noodles with the naturally raised pork.  This dish was good and had a lot of flavor.  It didn't seem as dry as the other dishes and the noodles didn't seem to have that off texture.\n\nSo right now I am still on the fence with this one.",2013-05-04 23:24:53,3,1,0,fake,0.1429421768707483,0,0,1,0,1.0,1,1
8zkkuk8KOoNojZhTx0j5KA,rYn38E8m7BfNplBgF9Hbxg,"Absolute hidden gem!\n\nThis restaurant is in a lttle yellow house on the edge of an industrial area of Antioch Pike north of Harding.  It's tucked away on the left two or three buildings up from the motel - it's easy to miss.  I've driven by it for almost two years every time we went to lunch at Siam Cafe and I always wondered about it because of the location and it never looked busy.  But today I discovered the trick, there is parking around back and that seems to be where everyone parks.  Inside is clean and neat with a gallery of photos by a local photographer for your enjoyment or purchase.  There is a deck out back but I did not venture out to investigate it this trip.\n\nFirst let me say this place was neat and clean - they scored a perfect 100 on their Metro Health Inspection!  The owners are very friendly.  I talked with them to get their story.  He has been baking since he was in his teens and in fact, his bakery back in Bosnia is still going strong.  They moved here 10 years ago and like most people from that region, they always tell you how appreciative they are for this country and the opportunities they have had here.\n\nI wasn't sure what I wanted to try first.  She had a Chevapi plate that she had prepared in the past for another customer that she thought I might like it - it was fiveor six pieces of chevapi with a sauce on top of vegetables and rice with a piece of homemade pita bread.  I also couldn't resist the cheese filled burak as I have had a Russian dish that was similar at Taste of Russia and miss it now that they are closed.\n\nShe brought the burek out first along with ShangriLa tea - I had it somewhere the other day but don't remember it being this good.  I only ate about a third wanting to save room for my chevapi plate.  It is wonderful.  The cheese is rolled up in a sort of phyllo or layered dough and then baked.  The outside is crispy, the inside dough chewy and the cheese wonderful.\n\nNext came the chevapi plate.  Chevapi is a minced meat/sausage like food from Bosnia.  Everything on the plate ws wonderful including the homemade pita that is a cross between the traditional pocket pita and the more breadlike pocketless pita.\n\nKnowing that he was a baker, I had to try the baklava and it was some of the best I have had without a doubt and it was a nice large serving (almost too much considering how rich baklava is) and fresh.  And to balance it out, I had a cup of Turkish coffee that was a perfect way to balance out the richness of the baklava.\n\nThis is so close to work that I will be a regular here.  The prices are good and serving sizes good for the price.  I can't wait to try several other things on the menu.  They have chicken livers and rice.  She told me to call ahead so that they can make sure they have fresh liver when I want to come try them.  And they have gyro and Euro burgers both your choice of beef or lamb.  She highly recommended their tiramisu.  And the bowls of soup looked nice and hearty.\n\nBeside the pastry case is another case with a small but interesting selection of imported food items.  They also had various sausages vacuum packaged for sale also.",2010-03-10 02:31:27,5,7,1,genuine,0.2716390306122448,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
8zkkuk8KOoNojZhTx0j5KA,5nmBa3L3Ntccvi-a_KMQAg,"I wanted to like this place more than I did. First the atmosphere - I did like the clean, open and modern feel. I did not use the restrooms but I noticed a long vanity with two sinks along one wall in the dining area that was very unusual and a little uncomfortable feeling and must admit I don't like it.\n\nI tried several dishes to get a feel and satisfy my cravings that night. I started out with the fried calamari. In an Asian restaurant I pretty much expect this to be a tempura batter or at least panko. These looked like the typical pre-breaded frozen calamari rings you can buy in the grocery and they pretty much tasted as much. Not particularly fresh and just a hit of toughness that comes from not being fresh or slightly overcooked.\n\nNext was the shrimp tempura. This was just ok. The only thing that kept it from being good to great was was such a small thing but the whole difference. The tempura batter was not cooked enough or the oil temp was not hot enough when they were dropped.It was soft, but not soggy, instead of crispy.\n\nMy biggest disappointment came in the Korean fried chicken wings. I wanted to try both sauces but on the side for several reasons. I wanted to taste them plain. I knew something would be going home with me and probably some of these and the calamari rather than the tempura so if they weren't sauced, they would reheat and crisp up better. And because I wasn't sure of which sauce I would prefer. I was told that they cannot send them out plain because they can't finish the dish that way. Well finish the dish out must have meant sprinkle the sesame seed on top of the sticky sauce coated wings and have it stick. I was not crazy about either sauce and particularly disappointed that they both had a good bit of sugar in them as I am diabetic and it's just something not needed to make the sauces good. And since I did take most of them home, they were soggy and did not crisp back up with reheating. I also asked them if their crust was gluten free and the waitress could not answer me nor the hostess but she said they could make it gluten free. That sort of made me uncomfortable with bringing my friend that truly has celiac here. We had another place that made all of their kfc and sauces gluten free.\n\nOverall it was an okay experience but not good enough that I really want to go back. There are several places that do these dishes well nearby though they don't all try to attempt so many different Asian styles under one roof.",2016-11-06 01:32:31,3,0,1,fake,0.0963485558157689,0,0,1,0,1.0,1,1

Certainly not the case with Bittersweet.\n\nOrdered a lemon/cream cheese custom cake with a thematic topper; actually dropped by earlier in the week to try the cupcake version of this creation (though with lemon curd, not cream cheese), and was quickly convinced that I'd made the right decision.

Emails were quickly responded to, even on Christmas, and interpretation of our desired theme was spot-on.\n\nA caveat - if picking up from the store, don't let the cake sit for too long outside of the refrigerator prior to presentation as humidity may cause the fondant to sweat and bulge; doesn't affect the flavor (probably tastes better a bit warmer, but takes a bit away from the presentation).",2018-12-31 23:17:07,4,1,0,genuine,0.1902494331065759,1,0,1,1,1.0,1,1
