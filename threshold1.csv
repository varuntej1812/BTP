The restaurant is located just outside the French Market on Frenchman St, in a lower-key, musically-influenced area of town.  I was looking forward to trying out their fried oyster po' boy, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of oysters.  They use only Louisiana oysters and because of the oil spill in the Gulf, they cannot serve any dishes with oysters.  Boo.\n\nI subbed in a fish (catfish, I assume) po' boy instead and it was delectable.  It had catfish, shredded lettuce, slices of tomato, mayo, and pickles, inside a loaf of French bread.  With a side of fries, it was yummy and filling.\n\nSmall note on the fries: the menus have printed the fries are only $1.50 extra when ordered with a po' boy.  However, the restaurant charged us $2.00 and the server told us there was a sign out front that noted the change.  The menus still say $1.50 though.  The restaurant needs to correct this.  How are you just going to leave incorrect pricing in your menu (50 cents isn't a lot, but it's the principle)?\n\nWe were told by our waitress to try their fried chicken next time.

Both businesses are located in Pie Town, a neighborhood on the southern edge of downtown Nashville. There's not a whole lot of stuff in this part of town. These are definitely two of the highlights.\n\nTennessee Brew Works opened on August 18, 2013. It's popular. This place has won numerous awards and earned plenty of recognition including the best brewery in Tennessee according to Yelp. These folks are all about being local, green, and sustainable. The taproom is two stories with views of the brewery from both floors. There's a patio with both covered and uncovered spaces (mostly uncovered) as well as a small, string-lit rooftop patio. As this is a brewery, the property has an industrial, warehouse feel to it, much like the other businesses in Pie Town. It's clean and modernized. The first floor of the brewery features a small stage for live music (a band was setting up on our way out) and the room upstairs, which is much more spacious, has TVs playing sports and nice overhead views of the brewery floor below.\n\nBrewery tours take place every Saturday at 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. It costs $10 plus tax and a fee per person. Tickets for the tour can be purchased online.\n\nAlong with high-quality craft beer, the brewery also serves food. Their limited menu includes apps/snacks like Baja fish tacos, Springer Mountain chicken wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches (including a Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich). Food prices range from $8 to $18 per plate.\n\nWe grabbed a few beers and hung out inside the taproom downstairs. Downstairs, they use barrels (some with tabletops) for tables with bar stools. We showed up around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. It wasn't slammed or jam-packed, but most of the tables upstairs and downstairs were taken. Our group of six was lucky to find a table in a corner next to some brewery windows. The atmosphere was very relaxed and laid back. The staff was cool and friendly. We all enjoyed our time here.\n\nI don't think Tennessee Brew Works has dedicated parking. We parked for free on the street (Middleton Street because we also went to Third Man Records).

j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,FvTfqugdlzQSvFB1RAafNQ,"Logan Circle, also known as Logan Square, is a public park located in the center of the Logan Square neighborhood (yes, same name) in Philadelphia. It's managed by the city's Parks & Rec department. This is a great sightseeing spot in Philly. I recommend it. The views are beautiful.\n\nSome quick Q&A:\n\n1. Why is it called Logan Circle?\n\nBecause it serves as a major traffic circle for Benjamin Franklin Parkway (https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-franklin-parkway-philadelphia), connecting it to North 19th Street, Vine Street, and Race Street.\n\n2. Why is it called Logan Square?\n\nBecause it was one of five squares originally planned for the city in 1864 by William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania.\n\n3. Who is the circle/square named after?\n\nJames Logan, 14th mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nLogan Circle is actually surrounded by three other parks: Aviator Park, Sister Cities Park, and Shakespeare Park (small). Combined, the land area for these four parks, including the roads (Benjamin Franklin Parkway is wide and scenic) is about four city blocks. So for a city park, it's not huge, but not small neither.\n\nThe highlight of Logan Circle is a large fountain in the center called the Swann Memorial Fountain: https://www.yelp.com/biz/swann-memorial-fountain-philadelphia-2. We visited on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and the park was filled with people, both locals and tourists. Even though there were signs that said no swimming in the fountain, I can't tell you how many kids I saw swimming and playing in the fountain. A lot. It almost looked more like a pool or water park than a historic fountain.\n\nLogan Circle is centrally-located between Philadelphia City Hall and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Rocky Steps: https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocky-steps-philadelphia). Benjamin Franklin Parkway connects all of it. If you've never been to Philly before and want to sight-see, I think walking the parkway between city hall and the museum is a must. Including the aforementioned adjacent parks, Logan Circle is surrounded by sights and attractions including the Franklin Institute, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nNote: At the time of writing this review, there's another Yelp listing for Logan Circle. It's called Logan Square Park: https://www.yelp.com/biz/logan-square-park-philadelphia. Technically, the two listings should be merged, but the Yelp moderators disagree.",2019-08-04 12:29:33,4,5,0,genuine,0.1406573498964803,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,bI2WySNWJYzAudmArswvAA,"I had a great experience with Assurant. I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a ""new"" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an ""unrecovered equipment fee"" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).",2019-02-03 16:24:22,5,8,8,genuine,0.23286951144094,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,xNTO7hUoAIx9I2uL0s8K-g,"The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest American professional sports franchises, established in 1883. Unlike other storied teams, the Fightin' Phils have never left their original city.\n\nIt took nearly 100 years, but the Phillies were able to win their first World Series championship in 1980 and then again, 28 years later, in 2008. In 1980, future Hall-of-Famer and perhaps the greatest third baseman of all time, Mike Schmidt, led Philadelphia to a 4-2 series win over the Kansas City Royals. In 2008, four-time All-Star pitcher Cole Hamels led Philly in a dominating series performance over the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1. (Since 2020, Hamels has played for my favorite team, the Atlanta Braves.)\n\nThe Phillies play at Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philly. The ballpark opened in 2004 and is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex which includes the adjacent Lincoln Financial Field (home of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles) and Wells Fargo Center (home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers). You can see the complex from the interstate (I-95) as you drive into the city from the airport. It's just across the Delaware River from New Jersey.\n\nThe Phillies haven't done well since 2011, the last year they made the playoffs. From 2012 to present, they've yet to finish a single season above .500 (they finished at exactly .500 twice, in 2012 and 2019), a far cry from their 2008 championship. However, the Charlie Manuel (manager) years (2005-2013), immediately preceding the current playoff drought, comprise a great era in Philadelphia's baseball history. Under Manuel, the Phillies made the playoffs five straight seasons (including that '08 World Series title), had first baseman Ryan Howard named NL Rookie of the Year in 2005 and then NL MVP the following year in 2006, shortstop Jimmy Rollins named NL MVP in 2007, and pitcher Roy Halladay named NL Cy Young Award winner in 2010. Unfortunately, the team hasn't been the same since Manuel's firing during the 2013 season.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Phillies have an all-time win percentage of .472 (9,853 wins against 11,032 losses).",2021-02-12 20:10:07,3,10,3,fake,0.1656926406926406,0,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,Ez_VZ6uSsna2r9tGKbWbKA,"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a ""KSOF"" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel. I recommend it.",2019-11-09 16:09:49,4,5,1,genuine,0.2553625541125541,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

xoZvMJPDW6Q9pDAXI0e_Ww,haeN53th7BKgUpkkpR9JtA,"If I want to escape from San Francisco and enter a time warp for a couple of days, I check in to the Peppermill Hotel in Reno, Nevada.  As far as Reno is concerned, this is as good as it gets, hence the 5-star rating.  However, if you are going to try to compare this experience to Las Vegas, it likely isn't going to measure up unless you restrict your comparison to being on-property at one place in Vegas.  I go to Vegas a dozen times a year, but I always take at least one trip to Reno to visit my beloved Peppermill.\n\nAll I can say is that the Peppermill in Reno provides me with something that even Las Vegas hotels do not, and that is a truly unique setting that enables me to feel completely isolated from the outside world...but in a good way.  It makes me feel like a kid again, playing in some big neon-clad fort that was created and added on to as needed over the years.  I love the casino, the diner, the little rooms with bars and video poker machines, the live music on the center stage, the pit bar, the sports book, the Fireside Lounge, and best of all, the newly built tower with fantastic updated rooms and suites.\n\nThe suite that I always stay in has a bar (complete with red velvet and undercounter red lighting) a living area with sofa, flat screen and a desk, and a powder bath.  The bedroom is large with cool lighting, a huge master bath, and televisions throughout.  The bathroom has a soaking jacuzzi tub, a glass enclosed shower, his and hers sinks, and a water closet.  For the price, this space provides a lot of bang for the buck, I guess.  You are in Reno, after all!  I usually wait for an offer in the mail to go so I am not paying full price.  I am never disappointed.\n\nThe property is not located downtown, so the only place you can really walk to is the Atlantis.  On the flip side, you don't have to deal with the crowds of downtown or the ""element"" that is more prevalent in that part of town.  I personally wouldn't stay downtown, but the Silver Legacy is nice to visit one day if you are looking for a change of scenery.\n\nI have not been to the pool, but it is heated and looks very nice.  I walk by everytime I go to the casino, so I can tell you that it is well-used.  The food (including room service) is good here.  They have plenty of options 24 hours a day, and the diner is a must at least once.  You can play Keno while you wait for your food if your palm is itching too much to take a break.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge is a really cool bar that I cannot leave out of this review.  It is unlike any other bar I have been to, with the exception of the one located in Vegas.  They have a firepit with a water feature and flat screen televisions blasting out music videos along with a number of other cool features.  They sometimes offer free appetizers, but I cannot tell you when because I am not sure.  I just happened across it a few times.\n\nI could go on and on about this place, but the bottom line is that it is fun.  It is my favorite place in Reno, as you may have guessed.  There is just something about this place.",2009-09-19 02:10:44,5,4,1,genuine,0.1984676736307171,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

Their Pizza is also really popular (i get the margehritta). You can order food to go which is great if you still have work to do in your room.\n\nFor drinks; its a brewery so of course they have wide selection of beer varietals. You can see some of the brew tanks inside the restaurant. They also house make their rootbeer, very tasty. They have a personal favorite on their wine list (ferari carano which you'll find throughout the El Dorado) and they have a full bar.\n\nI usually sit at the bar and most of the bar tenders are quick and friendly, Tim and Elijah have served me most of the times I've been and I feel completely comfortable sitting at the bar alone.

Its a great place to get your dance on without the club athmosphere.\n\nSince the restaraunt is at a casino there isn't a restroom inside, you have to walk just a short distance through some slot machines to get to it, not too bad exept the smell of ciggarette smoke is hard to avoid (not Brew Brothers fault though).",2011-02-21 18:40:06,5,0,0,genuine,0.2194709702062643,1,0,1,1,1.0,1,1

From NYC to DC, to Miami to L.A., to Boston to Chicago, I have not tried a better sangria than Modesto's. It's authentically-crafted with Brandy and simmered with sugar before cooling. It's pricey at $24/pitcher, but worth the praise you'll receive for suggesting it as well as the laughs that will soon ensue.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with the food.

Lobster crepes (stuffed with equally massive amounts of lobster), truly rich lobster bisque, moist tender rack of lamb, and obscenely intense veal tenderloin with exotic mushroom sauce (a special) were equally brilliant examples.\nMy only observation and minor nit about the food was that the meat was not precisely cooked - all the smaller medium-rare items were solidly medium, while the larger filet mignon, ordered medium, came out medium-rare.  But all were delectable, and very tender.\n\nDesserts were equally brilliant, from the Belgian dark chocolate mousse to the Austrian cheese strudel.\n\nThe wine list is reasonably large and well selected, especially considering the location, though the markup is enormous.  Unfortunately, due to the exorbitant licensing fees charged by Pennsylvania, this is more or less unavoidable, and with a careful search (and sufficient knowledge) reasonable value items can be found.\n\nService was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable (though the average wine knowledge of the servers isn't large).\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic meal in an out-of-the-way, rusticly romantic environment, look no further.\n\nThey also have a B&B with quite reasonably priced rooms on site.",2007-10-22 02:13:55,5,4,0,genuine,0.1949546485260771,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

I was greeted by the host and seated immediately.  My waitress was on top of things and the food came out on time an fresh.\n\nFood - I had the Tomato & Feta Bruschetta w/Baked Tortilla for an appetizer....it was awesome!  I highly recommend it.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  For an entree, I had the cheeseburger....I would have tried something else, but I really wanted to try the bruschetta appetizer and I didn't think I could eat that and an entree by myself.  The burger was excellent....just the right size, not too large and not too small.  The fries were steak-cut fries and cooked perfectly....not too hard/soft.\n\nAtmosphere - I was here in the Spring time and the weather was awesome....so I ate outside on the patio.  I'm glad I did....it was very relaxing.\n\nWine - The wine selection was decent....not great, but decent.  I had a glass of the Malbec....don't remember what the vineyard was though.\n\nWhile I was dining....there were no more than 5 tables occupied in the joint.

5cVgAicAhCTSrKzsKDuTdw,5gUZ-DSFUg-jxeaLPfDPvw,"4 stars. The Dish is a small restaurant tucked away inside a modern wine and cheese shop called the Rum Runner. Although we had the address, it took us a while because we were looking for a big sign that read ""The Dish"".\n\nThe setting is modern, intimate and may even feel a bit pretentious. Patron dress ranged from casual to dressy, but all pretty tidy. The ambience is best for couples, the tables are small, much like round bar tables where one might stand, although there are high stools available. The largest table I spotted could accommodate a party of four, rubbing elbows. Since we had kids in tow after a long day out, we decided that it would be more comfortable for us to buy take-out.\n\nThe food was very tasty, but the portions were not huge. We ordered a chicken dish, a pork dish, but our hands-down favorite were the steamed mussels, which not only tasted heavenly, but were also a phenomenal value, compared to other menu items. What puzzled me was that our waiter was a bit tentative about our take-out order, not being sure if our mussels could be made for take-out since it would be ""brothy"". Made me wonder if no one else had ordered take-out before. (""Things that make you go ""hmm..."") Bottom line was that they did have good take-out containers and none of the savory broth was spilled. Just didn't expect ""take-out"" that to be an issue at an establishment like this.\n\nThe prices were on the high side, but may be rationalized by the quality of the food. The ""jumbo shrimp with serrano ham"" was tasty but the size of the portion (and the shrimp) was a bit disappointing. Other than that, everything qualifies for ""thumbs up"". The complimentary bread was also very good.\n\nThe wine and cheese section carried a wide variety of wines and spirits. Dining patrons may order wine from the restaurant or pick a bottle from the wine shop but pay corkage. The cheese deli was also very diverse. We bought some very special and delicious fig tapenade, which was a new recipe from one of their chefs.\n\nVerdict: best for a romantic night on the town and if money were no object. Wasn't looking for oysters, but the mussels are a must-have.",2008-01-03 07:52:12,4,2,0,genuine,0.171042291042291,1,0,1,1,1.0,1,1

I should also note that I frequent some of the better Thai establishments around LA county so my review is probably bias.\n\nMeun Fan Thai simply fell on ""ok"" status for me. My girlfriend and I went here to have lunch one weekend and we were really disappointed by the limited menu offerings and the quality of the food after we had ordered. Sure this place is nice and clean, but just because you have a gold elephant on the wall, it doesn't make your restaurant legit Thai.\nOne of the first things that I noticed about the menu was the lack of noodle soups. Sure there are hot pot and tom yum but where's the boat noodle? That should be a simple thing to have on the menu and is usually a staple item on just about any Thai menu.\nMy girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai and while the color and flavor were present, the noodles were a shame. They were more pho noodle than typical rice stick noodle that pad thai usually is made with. This made it more soggy and not as good to eat.\nMy order of curry noodle had a brick of noodles sitting in curry sauce.  It was sad. How does one overcook a brick of pre-prepped noodles?\n\nAnyway, needless to say, 10$ per dish was not pleasing.

More often than not, it was the last stop on the crawl home from the bars.  Drinks are consistently strong, but pricey (I'm talking $8 - $10 a drink for a low range vodka and soda water).  They have a really lengthy martini list that is lots of fun if you're in an adventurous mood.  The service is friendly, and I love the ambiance - small, quaint, and cozy, white lights on the outside...Gypsy always looks warm and inviting.  \n\nThey sometimes have live music, a huge plus.  Most recently, there was a great cover band duo, which played everything from Lady Antebellum to Lady Gaga.  \n\nThe food - really tasty.  I especially love the lobster mac 'n cheese, it's amazing.  If you've ever eaten at Stella Blu, it's the same menu (same owners).  Gypsy would totally earn 5 stars in my book if it weren't for their prices...they are fairly steep.

I don't care what anyone says about the Steven Starr restaurants.  I've been to lots of different places, but this still always remains my favorite.  Village Whiskey is the best burger I've EVER had, no doubt.  Also some of the best alcohol-forward, ""Prohibition"" style cocktails I've ever had.  Not to mention their whiskey list is MILES long.  \n\nTrust me on this - order a Village burger, add the aged cheddar and an egg.  Yes, an egg - this is the crucial ingredient.  I can't speak for the fois gras - I don't eat it.  Anyway, do the above, and order it cooked M...it will be pink and juicy and heavenly.

Village Whiskey is SMALL though, really not much seating, and they don't take reservations.  So basically, it gets super packed.  Be prepared to wait, or venture in during non-peak hours.

IpLRJY4CP3fXtlEd8Y4GFQ,l77oQneNdxj4IUhusXqWGA,"I'm going to try to be as gentle as I can with this review.  I went to Total Serenity yesterday for a massage, and it was a horrific experience.  I'm trying to be gentle, because the woman who took care of me seemed to be somewhat nice. However, she has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE with professional massage. I get better backrubs from my 7 year old niece.\n\nI would have to agree with one of the other people who posted before me who said that the masseuse had no technique, just straight up and down rubs.  At first, I thought this was just her way of prepping or warming up my muscles. I kept thinking to myself,""Okay, NOW the real massage will begin!!"" LOL. Well, after saying that about 20-30 times, I knew this woman didn't know the first thing about a REAL massage. This made me mad, because my back and neck were full of stress knots.\n\nWell, the worst was yet to come.  She moved on to my legs and started doing some crazy technique that made me want to yell out in pain!!!  I get massages fairly often at other places, so I'm pretty sure she was doing it WRONG. Every person who ever massaged my calves and thighs did it in a relaxing way to get the kinks out.\n\nOn top of that, I think this woman had a BUTT FETISH!!!  LOL. I'm laughing right now, but I wasn't laughing yesterday.  As she massaged my thighs, she made sure to end each stroke with a handful of my butt.Each time, she stroked it slow and sensually, almost like she thought it was turning me on!  EWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't want that kind of massage from a woman!!!  It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage.

Usually not.\n\nSo in spite of all this, what is the appeal? Simply put Angry Chair makes some of the best beers in the country. Whether you're looking for a mouth puckering sour or a dense pastry stout, Angry Chair can and does knock it out of the park. Producing some of the most flavorful and unique barrel-aged beers I've ever tried, Angry Chair sets the beer game bar high.

Another winner, Barrel Aged Popinski with Peanut Butter & Marshmallow tastes like a fluffernutter. A bottle we got lucky enough to enough to happen upon by pure happenstance, Bourbon Barrel Dave's Barleywine, had an excellent malt backbone and tasted like toffee.\n\nThe taproom itself is trendy and industrial, with cool metal bone seats that are more decorative than comfortable. Funky art scattered about, and of course the many references to ""angry"" chairs make for a laid back atmosphere. While by no means a spots bar, they do have a couple of televisions as well should you want to watch the game with a cold brew.

A conference center and hotel, Gaylord Opryland offers ample walking paths, multiple restaurants, a river boat ride, a salon and spa, and now a water park as well. It is quite the labyrinth and is easy to get lost despite the signposts peppered throughout, although this often makes for the best exploration. While the hotel isn't located in the heart of downtown Nashville, it isn't a terribly far drive either.\n\nTaking a stroll through the atriums is like being in a tropical oasis. There are multiple waterfalls, streams, and lush foliage. While I have no idea what any of it has to do with Nashville itself or its history, it is quite lovely. The strategically placed oversized guitars feel a bit out of place, and yet seem more authentic to the local flavor. Compared to Gaylord Palms in Orlando which actually has decor centered around Florida (Evergaldes, Key West, and Saint Augustine), I felt less of the connection to the city here. However, I can't deny that the hotel is still quite picturesque. Visit around Christmas, and the entire hotel is bedecked in holly and strings of twinkling lights as well.\n\nLike any major hotel, Gaylord Opryland  comes with its pros and cons. The parking is high on my annoyance list, because although it is ample, it is pretty steep extra on top of the cost of your actual room. Whether you are a short term visitor, or a hotel guest, expect to pay around $32 a day. Also the restaurants are plentiful (think Italian, Mexican, sushi, and a grill), but none are particularly great. They do have Starbucks on premises if you are short on time, but walk or drive across the street to Nashville Coffees for a better selection and more interesting options.\n\nIf you are staying on business or at the hotel for a conference, the conference center is massive and quite convenient. There is more than enough space for an exhibition hall and smaller rooms for more intimate talks. WiFi is available throughout the area if you need to sneak away to get work done on your laptop. Speaking of the WiFi, you can also connect throughout the grounds or in the hotel rooms, and they have a direct wired connection if you need something faster, which makes a better choice if you need to connect to a VPN or are on a call.\n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable, although certainly some sections are better than others. For example, a room in Magnolia may have you in a fairly basic look (your standard outdated hotel) and a view of a courtyard/pool, whereas in Delta the rooms seem to be a bit more modern, and if you're lucky you can get a view of one of the domed areas, which makes for great people watching.\n\nWorth visiting at least once, even if you aren't a hotel guest!

Kellie even went out of her way to replace the feta cheese with some additional vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. Both were excellent, reasonably priced at $6.00-$7.00 and you could taste the love embedded in each.

There evidently was a dispute over what the repair center and what my insurance company were supposed to do, and it does appear that my insurance company bears some responsibility.  My primary concern is that when I spoke directly with the person at reception about having the repairs done, she neglected to tell me that there was a problem and that she needed additional information. Instead she told me everything was all set. I think she was overwhelmed and just wanted to move on to the next waiting person.  A week later, after having been told the car was completely repaired, I went to pick it up to find only half the work done - and, had to find this out myself.  No one at the repair service told me that they only did one part of the repair.  Poor, expensive, assembly-line service is what you will get at this place.\n\nReview Update:\nAs Shawn at Don Brown mentioned, after posting this review, I was immediately contacted by Pam in Customer Service.

They came out hours before the game and sat in the rain til it started. We watched the Phillies vs the Washington Nationals on Monday, May 21st. It was funny routing for the Nationals the day before. We arrived over two hours early and they had already opened up a limited section of the park. We got a drink at Harry The K's the restaurant in left field named after Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas. You can sit and watch the full game there as long as you keep buying. We watched the Phillies batting practice and walked around the park as it opened.

It also wouldn't be Philly without a replica Liberty Bell.  It ""rings"" and lights up after Philly home runs and wins. Unfortunately, we didn't see either. The Nats won. Another Philadelphia quirk is that their bullpens are in the outfield amongst the fans. When they first opened in 2004 the Phillies bullpen was closest to the fans and after Philly fans booed their own pitchers (these are the same fans that booed Santa Claus) they switched to have the visitors section closer for heckling.\n\nThe mascot always needs mentioning.

We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: ""What was her name?  She sounded hot.""\n  \nMe: ""Paige.""\n\nViper: ""Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?""\n\nMe: ""Good point.  At least we have that going for us.""\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",2012-01-03 19:26:16,4,3,6,genuine,0.2297974537037036,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1

Located in Mid-City, Li'l Dizzy's is a cozy diner serving up an all you can eat breakfast/lunch consisting of fried chicken, trout, shrimp creole, rice & beans, grits, gumbo, omelettes made to order, fruit, and maybe a few other items as well.  It was all pretty standard until I reached the gumbo.  \n\nLi'l Dizzy's gumbo is heavenly.  They don't hold back on either the sausage or the seafood as you have generous cuts of andouille sausage and crab legs in the wonderfully thick dark brown soup.  They got the flavor so perfect I felt no need to add any tabasco to my order.  I'd definitely come back here for the gumbo.  \n\nOverall, you have plenty of options for breakfast/lunch in this city, and Li'l Dizzy's is a good one if you are in Mid-City.  It's a great option if you just want a cup of gumbo.",2016-05-27 13:36:39,4,3,3,genuine,0.0985294117647058,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1
