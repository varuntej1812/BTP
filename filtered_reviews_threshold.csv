Perhaps its just the memories of my 8 friends and I weekly gathering along the long sushi bar after a long 6 hour class at Brooks... Or perhaps it was the half-price weekday lunch special that kept our wallets AND our stomachs pleased. The fish wasn't always daily fresh and the rolls could never be compared to Edomasa but the service was decent and the food usually hit the spot. For poor, hungry college students, something fishy is a great lunch spot.",2008-09-19,07:02:30

There are far too many other options in the area!  LOL\n\nS---    Honey's was so-so!!!\n\nThis pretty much sums it up.  I had pumpkin pancakes. They had far too much cinnamon. Also had eggs and potatos. The potatos were good, I suppose.  My boyfriend had a Poorboy, and thought it was mediocre at best too.  Not bad, Not good, just average.  Add the over-crowded atmosphere... and the place is just not worth standing in the rain for 20 minutes, (which some people did) or sitting in a tightly packed waiting area with somebody's BUTT in your face for 20 minutes.

We both ordered black tea to drink, but they did have a variety of loose teas to choose from as well.\n\nOverall, I'd say, the place is far too overpriced, because it simply doesn't have the ambience to charge so much money.

Sometimes I would have my students go down and pick up my orders for me when I was unable to leave the classroom.  Well, one of those times, I had my students pick up the order, I was supposed to get $10 back in change. I sent a note down with my students saying that his tip was $4.00 The delivery guy took it upon himself to pocket ALL of my change.  Mind you, I tip... and I tip NICELY, but I d-mn sure was not tipping him $14.00.  This made me angry, to know that he really thought he deserved that much money for coming around the corner and dropping off a cold box of pizza.  \n\nAs for the food, it's ok.  The pizza is good, when it's HOT. TWICE I ordered from them for my class pizza parties and it was delivered to me ICE COLD. They also make good strombolis and chicken cheesesteaks.

I went to Total Serenity yesterday for a massage, and it was a horrific experience.  I'm trying to be gentle, because the woman who took care of me seemed to be somewhat nice. However, she has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE with professional massage. I get better backrubs from my 7 year old niece.\n\nI would have to agree with one of the other people who posted before me who said that the masseuse had no technique, just straight up and down rubs.  At first, I thought this was just her way of prepping or warming up my muscles. I kept thinking to myself,""Okay, NOW the real massage will begin!!"" LOL. Well, after saying that about 20-30 times, I knew this woman didn't know the first thing about a REAL massage. This made me mad, because my back and neck were full of stress knots.\n\nWell, the worst was yet to come.  She moved on to my legs and started doing some crazy technique that made me want to yell out in pain!!!  I get massages fairly often at other places, so I'm pretty sure she was doing it WRONG. Every person who ever massaged my calves and thighs did it in a relaxing way to get the kinks out.\n\nOn top of that, I think this woman had a BUTT FETISH!!!  LOL. I'm laughing right now, but I wasn't laughing yesterday.  As she massaged my thighs, she made sure to end each stroke with a handful of my butt.Each time, she stroked it slow and sensually, almost like she thought it was turning me on!  EWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't want that kind of massage from a woman!!!  It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage. I can't speak on their other services, but massages are definitely not their forte'.",2011-07-08,21:39:56

I didn't eat everything that was brought out to me! \n\nI ate the bread and salad, but didn't care much for the vegetable cous-cous. I enjoyed my mint tea and pastries.... and loved that steamed  towels were brought out to us in between each course to clean your hands. \n\nWe also got a hookah.

My fiance and I stopped in to try it out and they took forever to give us our order, and when they did it was wrong. We were kind of in a hurry and thought we could stop in and get a quick dinner.

Two of them could have been starting orders from the quickly forming line in back of us.  At the second station, there were about 3 people putting the fixins inside of the pita. Again,  too many people at one station, confusing each other.  There were 3 more people at the last station, bagging orders and then the manager rang up the order.\n\nSoooo... with all of these PEOPLE, why is it that when I got home, my chicken shawarma pita wasn't even in the bag???

That didn't get you access to the animal farm area, or to the jungle gym, each of which has signs up that if you don't have a wristband, you'll be asked to leave.\n\nThe egg hunt itself was in a grove of trees, and they basically just took a couple hundred eggs of different colors, dumped them in the trees, by color, and told the kids to grab one of each color, then get their prize back.  Nice, but $16 nice?\n\nThe animal farm area looked nice from behind the fence, as did the jungle gym, but I'm not sure that they were worth paying the extra cash to get in, especially when there's a park with a huge jungle gym just a couple miles away.",2015-04-10,12:58:19

I'm not sure if someone behind the bar was turning the music down, and had to do it each time a song was played, or if their jukebox was broken, but it was pretty lame.

They tried to kill us on the price of the car, and misadvertised it, saying that they always post the online price of a car, assuming a $3,000 down payment at purchase.  So, the car that was advertised on Cars.com for $24,000 is really $27,000, but there's nothing on cars.com that says that.  We nailed them, and they agreed to give us the car for $24,000.

We didn't.\n\nWe sat and negotiated, and threatened to leave many times, but they came down to a monthly payment we were happy with, and we bought the car, but told us they couldn't service it, and wouldn't honor any of their complimentary oil changes, since it was a Mercedes.

Unfortunately, unless you request a bottle to be opened freshly for your glass, you risk getting a refrigerated glass of red.\nThe warm, soft, herbed focacia and infused olive oil brought to the table is delicious.

There was nothing special about the rice i mean it was just rice, the shrimp were over cooked, the ahi tuna was! lets put it this way we didn't eat it, the salmon was cooked perfectly, as well as the large diver scallop, the large stuffed oyster had a strange earthy grittiness and flavor to it,the seasonings were nothing special your straight forward salt and pepper,the platter was very much like the basic fair you get at your average seafood place on Cape Cod,we were fortunately already full from the breads and cheese platter and made due with the salmon and scallop. \nLastly I will say the place was very accommodating to special requests made by the guest and our server was the other highlight of the experience. \nShe was gracious, polite and totally let us enjoy ourselves without being all over us or rushing us. \nI wish I could remember her name, because she was really great.

First the atmosphere - I did like the clean, open and modern feel. I did not use the restrooms but I noticed a long vanity with two sinks along one wall in the dining area that was very unusual and a little uncomfortable feeling and must admit I don't like it.\n\nI tried several dishes to get a feel and satisfy my cravings that night. I started out with the fried calamari. In an Asian restaurant I pretty much expect this to be a tempura batter or at least panko. These looked like the typical pre-breaded frozen calamari rings you can buy in the grocery and they pretty much tasted as much. Not particularly fresh and just a hit of toughness that comes from not being fresh or slightly overcooked.\n\nNext was the shrimp tempura. This was just ok. The only thing that kept it from being good to great was was such a small thing but the whole difference. The tempura batter was not cooked enough or the oil temp was not hot enough when they were dropped.It was soft, but not soggy, instead of crispy.\n\nMy biggest disappointment came in the Korean fried chicken wings. I wanted to try both sauces but on the side for several reasons. I wanted to taste them plain. I knew something would be going home with me and probably some of these and the calamari rather than the tempura so if they weren't sauced, they would reheat and crisp up better. And because I wasn't sure of which sauce I would prefer. I was told that they cannot send them out plain because they can't finish the dish that way. Well finish the dish out must have meant sprinkle the sesame seed on top of the sticky sauce coated wings and have it stick. I was not crazy about either sauce and particularly disappointed that they both had a good bit of sugar in them as I am diabetic and it's just something not needed to make the sauces good. And since I did take most of them home, they were soggy and did not crisp back up with reheating. I also asked them if their crust was gluten free and the waitress could not answer me nor the hostess but she said they could make it gluten free. That sort of made me uncomfortable with bringing my friend that truly has celiac here. We had another place that made all of their kfc and sauces gluten free.\n\nOverall it was an okay experience but not good enough that I really want to go back.

The coffee was cold (it had obviously been sitting in the carafe for a long time) and barely passed as colored water; usually, the House Blend is medium-bodied and decently flavored.  The coffee here was incredibly weak and tasted off.  I would almost venture that they used a generic/less expensive coffee blend and just passed it off as the official blend.  The everything bagel was so salty that I had to guzzle 2 whole bottles of Nestle Pure Life in my car.  And I hate drinking plain water!  It was also way too dough and did not have the nice characteristic shell (the entire reason for going to a Manhattan Bagel in the first place versus Brueggers or Einstein's or Panera's).

So instead when you say you have a coupon for such and such deal, they start hmming and hawing about, ""Well, I don't see that we have that available."" They then proceed to offer you a deal that is twice as expensive. Eventually they would offer something similar that they were running and maybe we would accept. Their pizzas arrived hot and burnt as usual, and since I was a regular customer, they knew where in my development my house was so they no longer needed directions. I always paid by check. \n\nNow they flat out refuse to honor any deals, only offer menu price when I call and refuse to accept my checks.

The Smoothies are good though.\n\nI just dont know how long they can stay open with so many other better Vietnamese restaurants in the area, try it for yourself though!!",2011-09-20,05:55:56

The tofu was good... the pad thai was... well, I expected a lot more from ""The best pad thai in Nashville,"" as their sign and menu boasted.  I've also never seen pad thai made with the wide noodles?  I also feel like there were more sprouts than noodles in the dish.  Very, very dry as well.\n\nThe weirdest part was what my friend Jo ordered.  She got the pork lettuce wraps which was supposedly new to the menu.  I tried them, and still today I'm scratching my head about them.  When I put the wrap in my mouth, the filling immediately tasted like I was eating meaty spaghetti.  I have no idea why because it didn't seem to have any likeness to that with the exception of the vermicelli and pork.  Where on earth was the tomato flavor from?  Jo said she could taste it too, so I know I'm not crazy.  Weird experience. \n\nThe fresh rolls were average... not a fan of them being cut up like sushi, but that's me being picky.

However, we were hesitant to try GLC since it is associated with the Cheese Cake Factory (which is just horrible and not worth the calories IMHO).  Anyway, after reading fellow Yelpers (Thad S.) review and seeing some pics of the food http://bit.ly/NqjKJa, we decided to give this place a shot for a late lunch/early dinner.\n\n- Asian Short Rib Tacos: Very good, we would get that again\n\n- Crispy Calamari: We had ordered the Calamari from the  'Small Bites' menu but our server ended up giving us the larger  'Grand Fried Calamari' app instead. I was a mistake, no problemo....... As I started to eat the Calamari, I happily commented how light the batter was (the way it should be).  However, as we got toward the middle of the bowl, it was a clumpy/over battered mess. The accompaniment of (2) sauces were just too mayonnaise'y (we had to ask for some lemon slices to squeeze over the calamari & the sauces to cut the richness). Just a note: I think the Calamari should be served on a plate instead of  a bowl so steam is not trapped (to avoid mushiness). \n\n- Turkey Burger:  This was excellent (one of the best I have had in a while). Turkey Burgers can be dry but this was very moist and super flavorful. It had finely minced mushrooms, garlic & spices mixed into the patty. (almost tasted sirloin'ish). Next time I will ask them to hold the red onion jam, it was too sweet for me. Instead of fries, I got the  side mixed salad that was very good! The dressing was a light tasting vinaigrette.\n\n- Avocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger:  EPIC FAIL..... just  horrible. The top of the bun was very greasy (almost as if they brushed butter on it before serving). The meat was completely FLAVORLESS.  The bottom of the bun was super soggy. The condiment portions were too much, it made the burger very messy and very hard to eat. The side of fries were okay. I prefer skin-on style fries (maybe I am spoiled from all the gastropub fries in Philly?)\n\n- Our server (Remy ?) was EXCELLENT. She had an addictive smile, was super friendly and attentive! Our water glasses were continuously  refreshed. She gave us the right mix of attention and space. \n\nEven though we had a few misses, we liked the place overall enough to warrant another visit (next time we will do dinner and try some entrees)\n\nMe",2012-07-22,20:01:21

I would of preferred more of a vinegar'ish kick than sweet.\n* Cornbread - Fantastic! \n* Bread Pudding - Very good\n\nPricing: Reasonable but I felt that the side dish portions ($2.50 a piece) were skimpy.

Here are my thoughts to add to the rest:  \n\n""I'm not talking about oranges."" - Mandarin is a step up from Nectar on the trendiness scale.  Since it's on the second floor, there are some nights where you'll go on the elevator to get up to Mandarin while there are other nights you'll go the back route and hike up the stairs in your stilettos.  This might confuse some people in thinking that they're special cause they're going the ""back way"" when in reality, everyone is going through the back way.  Oooh, those psychological tactics!!    \n\n""I see red..."" - Some say that they are ""trying too hard to be cool"" which may or may not be true, but that's how they want to roll.  If other lounges are doing it, why can't they?  It just feels a little bit awkward at times cause it's St. Louis and maybe it's the people they are attracting that are trying too hard and not the lounge.  For all you Chicagoans, do you guys remember the now defunct, Reserve on Lake Street??  Mandarin is EXACTLY like Reserve with the same type of drink concept (Mandarin can serve up an expensive drink with flecks of gold in it while Reserve had this thousand dollar drink with a diamond in it), Reserve had DJ AM coming in from time to time doing mashups, Mandarin has mashups from....well, our top local DJs.  So is this place full of pretentiousness?  Yes, it is.          \n\n""The view from the top"" - The one and only thing I like about this place is the view of the CWE and its fountain from their terrace.  On a nice, cool Summer or Fall night, it feels amazing to be out there (that's if they aren't packed to capacity).  The one thing that would get me to come out to this place is for a special event, other than that, it gets way too crowded and I feel like I'm back in an undergrad bar again, only this time I'm wearing better clothes and am surrounded by people with money or pretend to have it.",2009-06-03,07:09:37

As for the bus terminal it's nice, they tend to be on time in the morning and overall they are getting better.  At night it gets a little sketchy but they do police it quite well.  My big complaint isn't about Music City Central per se, it's the fact that I can't get on a bus on the east side and ride it over to the west side, or Vandy, or whatever you want to call it, without stopping over.

For starters, they are playing it fast and loose with their french toast. Cutting a biscuit in half, searing it, and smothering it in sugar syrup does not make it french toast. The only word to describe it is cloying. My second beef with Biscuit Love lies in the biscuit. I tried my honeycake's biscuit and it was sweet. Why?! It should be salty. It was fluffy so that was great, but it missed the mark. My last issue with Biscuit Love goes beyond Biscuit Love, but to the new trend of novelty restaurants. Classic standbys are closing while a place serving oversize, overpriced biscuits succeeds with a huge boost from the tourist population. It's like being on Man Vs Food everyday.

I have never been to Chicago so I can't say I've ever had the real thing. Part of the reason I've only had it a few times is because it's just not my thing. It's too heavy. Plus, I'm a die-hard NYC style pizza fan.\n\nSo earlier in the day I went to Bella Nashville and consumed their meat pizza with an egg. It's by far one of my favorite pizzas in Nashville. I did this not knowing that after my top dog's game we were going to 312 to watch the World Cup and eat more pizza. My friend said it best though, ""it's not pizza, it's a pizza casserole."" Amen!\n\nWe ordered two deep dish pizzas, wings, and numerous drinks. The place wasn't packed but there was a good crowd. Our waiter forgot three of the drinks and to put the wing order in. He apologized profusely and comped the wings. He did everything he was supposed to so I'm not totally faulting him but you know, it was a hiccup. The pizza was good, my manbot says great, and the wings were just fine as well. I had a vanilla donkey (I think that was the name) to drink and it was fantastic. We also tried the weird shot that Chicagoans adore? and I will say, ""no, never, it just sat in my throat and I will never drink it again."" I don't regret trying it though. I love regional drinks.\n\nOverall all this is what Germantown has been missing for quite some time. It's a place where you can come drink, or you can come eat. It's family friendly and sports friendly. The TV's are huge and viewable from anywhere. The room is clean, open, and well-lit. This also causes it to be loud. So be prepared. Overall, kudos to the space. I liked it a lot!\n\nI'll definitely be back, probably to try the arancini and mozzarella sticks. I hear they are HUGE! I'll also be back because I like the environment. If you are a Chicago pizza eater, then you must try it. If you're not, then there are other items you can choose from even numerous salads that don't seem too heavy.",2014-07-14,17:04:12

The crowd was much more subdued which allowed for it to be a bit more family friendly and enjoyable. While I do miss the days of Deadrick being closed and the ticket system, I did enjoy the festival.

The four-cheese gratin didn't add any flavor.\n\nI got cottage cheese as my side, but couldn't help myself and ordered fries, too. Our server described them so beautifully.\n\nThe fries were homemade, skin-on and crispy. They were so dark, they almost looked overcooked, but they were perfect! Yum!\n\nNobody needs that much starch in one meal, but those rolls were so amazing, we just sat there and ate them all!\n\nThen we ate our sandwiches and fries, and rolled back to work.\n\nTwo of us had hefty to-go vessels.",2012-11-18,16:01:29

But the bar was PACKED at 5:30 p.m. And the lights were so dim I could hardly scan the bar guests to see if my dining partner was there. Finally decided not, and went to sit at the bench in front for arrival. Felt like a refugee . . . not one of the hostess persons said anything to me.\n\nWhen my dining partner arrived, we decided to take a table, since the restaurant was barely inhabited.\n\nWe shared calamari appetizer. It was fine, but there were some huge pieces of intact tentacles in it. Is that normal? Never seen that before. I actually had to spit one huge mass of chunky tentacles into my napkin. I was going to choke on the dang thing. Not a pretty way to take it to infinity and beyond!\n\nWe both had the biestecca insalata . . . a wedge ($6). It's always divine, and it's really a meal in itself. Dining partner got a flatbread ($13), of which ate one piece. I got chicken milanese ($21). I totally misread the description. The chicken was breaded (which I hate), and it was sitting on a bed of spaghetti (which I hate). I had one bite, and took the rest home. Somebody will eat it.\n\nDuring dinner, a bug came crawling across the table on my side. I just watched incredulous of this happening. It took a turn on the white tablecloth towards my dining partner's salad. She swatted at it. It kept going. Disappeared somewhere.\n\nIt's amazing two women at a table with a bug didn't jump up screaming and make a scene. Brio should have been grateful to us for that.

I came expecting the same taste, same service, and same set up as Long Wong's.  What I got surprised me.\n\nThe store stands alone among an unpaved parking lot.  There are three rooms open to the public, the area you walk in to order and two rooms on either side for dining (one is more of a bar area, but there are tables in here too).  The cooling system consists of swamp coolers.\n\nWe opted to sit in the room to the right, which had more natural light and no bar, but there is a giant rear-projection TV and a pool table.  Before our food arrived the ice machine stopped working, alerting everyone in the restaurant with a series of beeps every few seconds.  We picked up our drinks and walked over to the bar dining area.  Very dark with a view straight into the bathroom.\n\nThe menu is wider and more varied than at Long Wong's.  They have a whole side dedicated to food other than wings, (burgers, salads), but I chose to eat wings: Mild, Medium, Hot, Suicide*, Cajun, Garlic Parmesan, White**, Lemon Pepper, BBQ, Honey BBQ, Honey Hot, Honey Gold, Teriyaki.  I got medium, honey bbq, white something, and honey bbq.  A dozen wings sampler for $7.50.  Two varieties would have been $6.50.\n\nThe mild-suicide is self explanatory, the flavor getting progressively hotter as the scale goes up.  Each hot wing flavor is mouth watering.  I need to rebuild my suicide hot resistance.\n\nThe wings are very crispy.  Way crispier than at Long Wong's.  If it were not for this inconvenience, their stars would have been upped.\n\nThe paying process is different than what I came expecting: at LW, you pay first, but here, you pay at the end of your meal.  It is standard wing fare, no bill is ever brought to you, you simply walk up to the counter.\n\nThe staff members are friendly and aren't adverse to small talk.  If anyone reading this is familiar with Long Wong's, the chicken wings are cooked longer here.  Because of this longer cooking, the chicken was crispier and harder to lick every last morsel off the bone.\n\nEach wing order comes with celery sticks/carrots and a choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.\n\n*'Suicide' is what they're called at Long Wong's, they are called 'no mercy' here\n**White wings is the correct name",2009-01-07,01:55:47

The marinara sauce is not too sweet, not too tomatoey, not too bitter.  The fettuccine alfredo is bland and requires lots of red peppers.

The complimentary edamame was nice, but cold. I prefer my edamame nice and hot.\n\nThe sushi was just terrible. The dynamite roll literally had PILES of chile pepper flakes or whatever that powder was on them, and even after scraping it off, they were so incredibly spicy to the point they weren't even good.

I figured restaurant-goers would want to know about my abysmal encounter with one of the employees (possibly a shift manager, I'm not sure).\n\nI took my dad from out of town to the Black Thorn tonight. I just moved into the TGS neighborhood, the place is only a couple blocks from me, and had heard great things about their pizza. As everyone else said, the place is a gritty dive, and I enjoyed that aspect of it. The pizza itself, after waiting an hour and a half for it (which I didn't mind, we had a good time in the interim), tasted great.\n\nThe problem was that it wasn't, after all that waiting, what we ordered. My dad had ordered a supreme; was very clear - ""I want everything on it - no, not tomatoes, anchovies and artichokes, but everything else."" When it came out, they called up ""Mike F"" (we even had our initial behind it, so it was very clearly meant for us) and it looked like sausage. I was wary, but having never had deep dish before, we thought maybe the rest of the ingredients were inside. Poked at it, took a few bites. Nope, definitely just sausage. Someone must have put the wrong order in. We weren't going to wait ANOTHER hour and a half for them to remake it, so we went ahead and ate it. It *was* delicious. But not what we ordered, or paid for. I took a piece up to the man behind the bar that took my order to make sure it was sausage and calmly explain what happened, and see if we could just get the extra $4 difference back. Our exchange went a little something like this:\n\nHim: ""You ate it?! You ate someone else's pie!""\nMe: ""It's under Mike F, you gave this to us. I didn't know if it was supreme in the deep dish."" \nHim: ""God damn it! What were you thinking?!"" then screaming at the bar, pissed off: ""Is there a Mike F at the bar? Because if so, this girl ate your pizza."" The people at the bar looked shocked and embarassed for me; some nervously giggled, some gave me dirty looks. I was MORTIFIED. \nI said, ""No, Mike F is us! And this is what you gave us!"" \nHe's pacing, mumbling things, yelling at the other employees about this awful travesty I committed, flailing his arms about and making a big scene, and told me: ""You should have brought it back!"" \nMe, raising my voice now: ""I didn't want to wait another hour for you to cook another one!"" \nHim, yelling back: ""You wouldn't have had to...god damn it! Shit. YOU DON'T JUST EAT SOMEONE ELSE'S PIZZA!"" \n\nI said, ""You know what, forget it"" and stormed off to my table while he's yelling at me to ""come back and deal with this."" I'm so shocked and appalled I'm in tears.\n\nI'm at my table shaking in anger. I've lost my appetite. Another employee who witnessed the exchange comes over and apologizes on his behalf, saying, ""He gets like that"" offered to buy us a beer or something, and then said she'd talk to him and see what she could do. Turned out that he wrote ""sausage"" on the order....but still charged us the extra $4 for a supreme. So HE made the exact mistake I suspected. It wasn't someone else's pizza, it was ours. HE fucked up, and I WOULD have had to wait another hour for the right one. Yet he assumed I was a selfish fuck-up and instigated a screaming match at the bar as he accused me of stealing someone else's pizza. \n\nHe comes over a few minutes later (obviously because the girl went back and told him he's got damage control to do) and his ""apology"" was ""Sorry for getting like that, but I'm really busy."" Nice excuse (and they weren't even all that busy. The place was only half full on a Saturday night. Even then....there's no excuse!). He said he'd give us the $4 back. He also asked my dad how he paid for the pizza. ""Oh, you paid cash? SWEET. Because if you paid by card it would have been this big pain in the ass to refund you the money on the card."" Wow, how many excuses does this guy have? If we paid by card, would he have caused yet another dramatic shit storm over it? \n\nThe girl comes back over to see what he did, and she says, ""Uhhh he really should comp you the whole pizza. But I'm not the boss, he is."" (My dad asked if he was the owner and she said no, so that's my thinking in that he's a shift manager) He comes back over a few minutes later and comps us the whole thing (again, I think he was nudged to do so). And apologized again. I told him, ""Being busy is a SHITTY excuse. I've worked fast food, I've waited tables, and I'm a nurse on a busy floor in a city hospital - I know busy. You DON'T talk to people like that. You need a lesson in customer service."" At this point, he did seem sincerely sorry. I said I appreciate him trying to rectify the situation.\n\nBut I'm so infuriated I'm never going back. And telling all my friends to avoid this place like the fucking plague.\n\nI would give this place ZERO stars if I could.

The menu was interesting since they offer other kinds of fruit bowls in addition to the traditional acai bows and smoothies. I decided to be creative and ordered the kale bowl which was blended with fruit and came with granola and honey on top. My BF ordered smarter and got the beach bowl which is one of their best sellers and added peanut butter for an extra charge.

Everything sounded good, but I decided to go the taqueria route and had a chorizo and pastor taco with a side of guacamole. You order to the left side and they had just installed a new ordering system so the lady at the counter had trouble placing my order which resulted in a very long line of people trying to order behind me. They offer a decent amount of seating and the first two orders in our group came out quickly, but I had to pay attention to get it because I didn't get a receipt with a number so I best guessed it. The last two in my party weren't so lucky.

The tacos are WAY overpriced for what you get; I've tried everything from lobster tacos (at roughly $4.50 PER taco) to the veggie and chicken ($3ish). Not impressed with any of them. Plus the salsa costs extra (I hate when they do that!). The enchiladas are better than the tacos if you are forced to eat here, but even then they are sub par for what you pay. \n\nI've had mixed experiences with the drinks; the red sangria was tasty on one trip, the next time I had a pitcher with a friend and it was watered down. The last time I went I had a mojito and it was good, so it varies. \n\nI wish The Local Taco was good because it is so close to my house. I've given it multiple chances and was disappointed with each experience. I find it sad that a place with ""taco"" in the name doesn't have good ones! I'll go to a taco truck for my fix!",2012-07-25,18:49:19

The restaurant is clean and open with lots of space. I also noticed right away that they offer wine and beer and they have a nice outdoor seating area. \n\nWe ordered the grilled lamb gyro and chicken salad with 2 waters, and it was around $18.00. Maybe I was thrown off by expecting the food and prices of my run of the mill Greek places, but I thought it was a bit steep for what we received. The chicken was bland and the lamb was not shaved in strips like most Greek places. The lamb was just OK and I liked the dill sauce but overall it was lacking. I had the tomato cucumber salad on the side that was my favorite part of the meal because it was seasoned well. I also had potato chips on the side, which I found odd. I would have ordered something else if I had known. \n\nOverall, I've had better and will go somewhere less glamorous for my Greek food because I feel that you pay for the interior rather than a good meal.",2012-10-03,16:31:09

The interior is gorgeous and well-themed and the outdoor space makes you feel that you are transported to an island. Plus I love the cabanas and the overall vibe is really cool and interesting. \nHowever, there were some pretty significant issues. First, you have to order at the bar or window connected to the outdoor space. I definitely had more luck at the bar, but just come here planning to wait to order. That alone isn't a dealbreaker though. I'm fine to wait if I'm getting some interesting drinks and delicious food. Unfortunately Pearl Diver didn't deliver there either. While the port to port cocktail was delicious, it only tasted like fruit juice and was very weak. If I'm paying $12 I want it to taste like an adult beverage. I tried the Paloma later and it was better but also very weak and mostly ice. I was excited about the food but bummed when the mushroom and shishito peppers came out with a laughable amount. There were seriously 5 of them on a skewer and the mushrooms were a huge let down and not worth $9 for these items. Luckily the dumplings and dipping sauce were good so it wasn't a total waste. \nAt the end of our night we enjoyed talking to the bartender and sampled a shot of the daiquiri which was delicious and what I should have ordered instead of the other fruit heavy beverages I sampled. The bottom line is that I paid $50 leaving hungry and completely sober which makes me grumpy. Luckily I was hanging out with an awesome group of ladies so it wasn't a total loss but I'm not rushing back, especially since it's the new place to be and super popular.

B&B's didn't disappoint. It was very unique with fennel (which I usually despise but liked in this case), peanuts, and I think it was grapefruit. It was so good and probably my favorite part of the whole meal. I ordered light and had the kale salad. It wasn't the best kale salad that I've had; probably wouldn't order it again. My BF had the burger and it was good, but nothing stand out. The other couple liked their food, but no one was raving. \nI broke the hesitancy and ordered dessert (you're welcome!) and that was a good choice. We had the peanut butter and banana whoopee pie and a panna cotta. We each had a cappuccino as well. Our coffees were delicious and the desserts were very good. The highlights of the meal were definitely the dessert and appetizer, with our main courses leaving us ""OK'ed"". \nThe entire menu looks great so I am very happy to head back and give them another shot.

She chose the restaurant, having been there before, and chose the 8:30pm seating time for our party of 10. The restaurant is located off of South Street on this almost alley-like street, and the moment you walk in you grasp the concept they're trying to throw out at you: a traditional Moroccan-style meal in a setting that's supposed to mimic Moroccan interiors, with loud Middle Eastern style music (that sounded like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack). Rugs are everywhere, on the floor and wall, and you sit on low couches or cushion stools around round tables. \n\nThe meal is a 7 course prix fixe $35 per person (no a la carte menu), although they do have vegetarian alternatives to the meat dishes. The only menu they hand you is the drinks menu, which ranges from beer to wine to rose water to Coca cola. The menu is as follows:\n\nFirst course: 3 salads, eggplant, tomato-cucumber, and carrot\nSecond course: phyllo pastry filled with chicken and egg with powdered sugar and cinnamon on top. Vegetarian alternative is without chicken, just egg.\nThird course: Whole chicken, slow-cooked, either mild or spicy (we asked for spicy sauce on the side). Vegetarians get a lentil dish.\nFourth course: Either honey lamb or beef shish kebabs, we asked for both. Vegetarians have a spinach-filled rolled pastry.\nFifth course: Couscous topped with chicken, raisins, and vegetables. No chicken for vegetarians.\nSixth course: Fresh fruit bowl\nSeventh course: mint tea and baklava.\n\nThe meal was awful from the start. They sat us all the way at the top floor, in the back - we're pretty sure they continuously forgot about us throughout the meal. Our waiter looked like he was in high school, and it took him 15 minutes to get our drinks (only 4 people ordered anything); in the mean time, the music was so obnoxiously loud we could barely talk to one another, let alone the people next to us, and the air conditioning was so high that I was shivering - and I was wearing a sweater! - and even after asking them to turn it down, it was STILL cold.\n\nConsidering that its a prix fixe menu, you would expect the food to come out quickly, but we waited about 45 minutes for the first course, which isn't even cooked! Our waiter was not attentive in general, and each course took far too long to come out (he also took forever to realize we were done with each dish). The food overall was not good - edible, but where were the spices? The FLAVOR?! My bf said the lamb was good, but otherwise we were all very disappointed in the dishes. And there was waaaay too much food, we felt bad towards the end because of all the wasted food since we could barely have more than a bite of the later courses. The fruit plate mostly went into people's purses. I was most disappointed by the baklava, which was truly awful just phyllo pastry and honey WHERE WERE THE NUTS?! I'm Greek, I love baklava and this was awful. \n\nPerhaps the worst part of the evening, after suffering through awful service, bad food and too much of it, obnoxious atmosphere (which includes a belly dancer going around to each table), the waiter brings the bill and tells us AT THAT MOMENT that they take cash or check but NOT credit cards. They didn't tell us when we made the reservations, they didn't tell us at the beginning of the meal to allow us to run to a bank and get money, they had the audacity to tell us right at the end. I thought he was joking, but no. We managed to pool enough cash together, but the entire experience was not worth it and I will NEVER go back there.

However, since I'm in Philly alot and I really only drink US microbrews and other imported beer, I needed to find a place that can accommodate my needs. \n\nThe Foodery is able to do that - they stock (or can stock according to their price list) all the breweries and beer styles that I love, and buy it by the bottle instead of massive amounts of one type. Its nice because it allows me to try new beers without the worry of disliking and then having to get rid of the rest, a total waste of money. The nice thing is that although all the beers on display are refrigerated, they have the same bottles in the back room that they can fetch for you so you don't need to immediately refrigerate your purchases.\n\nMy only grumbling comes from the fact that their space is small so they don't stock as many different breweries/styles at once as I would like, and goddamn are those prices high! Stupid PA laws. And I agree, they should really post the prices RIGHT IN FRONT OF the beer in question instead of having that ONE huge price list which you have to search through endlessly.

I grew up with one of their stores a block away from my house, and every time I walked past it I would gaze longingly at their window displays and all of the kitchen appliances and tools that I so desperately wanted and could not afford (yes, at the tender age of 8 I was coveting cooking and baking supplies. I'm weird.).\n\nNot much has changed since then - although some of their less pricey items I can afford now. But its still the things like the KitchenAid stand mixer and food processor and the Le Creuset dutch ovens that remain out of my reach - and their so-called sales can be frustrating. Don't tease me by saying the new Cuisinart food processor was originally $450 and your price is $249 - its still a lot of money! I know I shouldn't complain too much, I am talking about top of the line products, but some of their inventory is just silly. Particularly the gourmet food items. \n\nThere are other places in Philadelphia where you can find all the necessary AND more obscure items to stock your kitchen with; in fact, they have better selections and prices than Williams-Sonoma! Plus, the staff here are just not as nice, pleasant, and genuinely interested in finding you THE perfect item for your specific needs as at other stores. The staff is helpful and pretty friendly provided the store isn't mobbed, but for some reason I've just received far more personal attention at places like Kitchen Kapers and Fante's.",2009-11-21,18:22:11

The exterior is very stereotypically Old World, what I would expect to find in a (touristy) mountainous town in Europe. But it took me about...3 years?...to finally walk into this traditional bakery, that has been in CC longer that I first realized.\n\nOne reason I never walked in was because you can't see inside - and it makes a big difference to the average passerby to see what they may be walking into. The interior is incredibly nondescript and in stark contrast to the bright red exterior with its white trimming. It's also quite large, and if I recall correctly there are a few seats available for customers. The counter spans two sides, one length filled with their cookies and another countertop holding their mini pastries, cakes and cupcakes. I had perused the Yelp reviews at one point and had heard mixed things about their signature dessert cake, so instead of getting that I decided to go basic because if a bakery can't do simple, classic baked goods then there's a problem with everything else. I picked up a chocolate cupcake and several different cookies to share with my fiance after dinner that night.\n\nI tried the chocolate cupcake first because I am the cupcake queen (according to fam and friends), and was instantly disappointed. The cupcake in general was kinda meh, a very light chocolate flavor to both cake and frosting, and the cake itself was not moist and very airy, like munching on foam. Next up came the cookies, which my fiance always has a strong opinion on:\n\nPeanut butter cookie had a dry, sandy cookie texture of the traditional PB cookie type, but it barely tasted of peanut butter!\n\nChocolate chip cookie was very average, in general it was like what you can get from chain supermarkets like genuardis with a crisp, sandy-ish crunchy texture, but the cookie dough base is a total waste with no flavor (do they not use brown sugar?)\n\nChocolate dipped pecan cookie is delicious - they're good at making that sandy texture kind of cookie, and the pecan flavor is pronounced\n\nHazelnut chocolate sandwich cookie was also delish, very nutty, crunchy with a good amount of chocolate ganache at the center\n\nVanilla butter cookie with a white chocolate center and the chocolate butter cookie with a semisweet chocolate center were both tasty versions of the classic recipe\n\nFor most of the traditional cookies, Swiss Haus seems like a pretty good place to pick up a large assortment for parties and get togethers, but when it comes to their other baked goods...well, there sure are a lot of bakeries around CC where you can get your cake-fix.",2013-05-28,10:35:46

The first time my bf brought me here was back when I first started visiting Philadelphia. We had been walking around all day exploring CC and I was in need of an energy boost - which worked great with his plan to bring me here anyway! \n\nWe entered and I was surprised by how big the place is. There's a dining area on the left that has table service, and where you can try the 'More' on their menu. The ice cream parlor is on the right, with some small tables where you can bring your tasty treat, or if the weather is nice eat outside at the tables they set up there. The staff is very sweet and patiently waited as I weighed my ice cream options. They also have a selection of baked goods, but its all about trying the ice cream for me. We ended up getting two different flavors to share - their banana one (I feel like there was another flavor, but I can't remember) and rocky road. The ice cream was creamy and cool, but that banana flavor just didn't do it for me. I guess I just don't like banana ice cream because my bf was more than happy to consume it for me. He did let me eat most of the whipped cream anyway :) And our serving size was rather large for only two scoops, athough overall their menu seems slightly pricier than necessary. This is a fun, cute place to stop by for tasty ice cream treats in the flavors you grew up with and love.

The decor is nice, modern and colorful in that trendy way with subdued lighting. We quickly looked over the many options their restaurant week menu had before choosing to share the following: \n\nCrispy maitakes with citrus dipping sauce: akin to mushroom tempura, quite light and crispy and the dipping sauce was nice, similar to aioli\nTuna & crab roll with ginger-yuzo cream, preserved papaya, sesame crisp: NOT sushi like we were expecting, it's a small portion of tuna tartare with avocado mousse, and crabmeat wrapped in a slice of raw tuna. Good, but nothing special.\nLobster paella: YUM, filled with bites of seafood (lobster, shrimp, clams), chicken and chorizo, quite tasty although the rice didn't have a strong saffron flavor. Perfect warm dish on a winter evening\nRoasted pork chop with apples, brussel sprouts and parsnip purée: the best dish of the night according to my bf, each flavor complemented the others perfectly, a very harmonious dish\nCaffe con Leche Panna Cotta with steamed milk and an almond-cinnamon biscotti: very good, the panna cotta was creamy and the biscotti was crunchy\nApple Cider Fritters with madagascar vanilla bean ice cream and apple cider caramel: Delicious! more like three donut holes than ""fritters"" \n\nOverall, I have to agree with Karen F - food is close to 4 stars, but the service was around 2-3, so its really more like 3 1/2 stars total for our visit. Our waitress was nice, but it felt like we received the minimal amount of attention necessary and our entrees took a considerable amount of time to arrive. Also, overall the portions here are quite small - a three course dinner is enough to satisfy but not fill you up (and I don't know how those entrees could feed a single person on their own).",2011-01-24,02:13:36

We're usually really good at checking out new sushi joints, especially if they're in our neighborhood, but we were disappointed when we saw that, unlike several other sushi places nearby, they don't offer a maki roll special for dinner, JUST for lunch during the week, and the individual roll prices are on the high side. \n\nBut I really wanted to try them out, so we stopped by on a Sunday to pick up a few rolls: spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and yellowtail scallion. The exterior makes it feel like they're not open because of the dark interior and blinds that are mostly drawn. The immediate entrance is severely lacking, but up the stairs they've redone the space nicely in a typical sushi bar manner - dark, dark, dark. The hostess was very polite, and came back with our sushi order almost immediately after giving it to the chefs. \n\nThe regular rolls may be more expensive, but at least they give you 8 pieces for each, so I felt a little better about spending a bit more - especially after tasting each one. The fish was pretty fresh (from what I could tell based off of the yellowtail), and my fiancé was quite pleased that the spicy rolls were actually SPICY, and I have to agree - usually I don't find spicy rolls spicy whatsoever, but these had that nice kick. He also thought that the sushi rice was quite good. We'll see if we ever get around to trying their special rolls - they're also pricier on average than other places - but if they don't extend the roll specials to be available all day, I think we'll stick to Machi as our neighborhood quick sushi fix.",2013-04-08,12:01:02

But to convince him to accompany me to the Kimmel Center's free holiday tuba concert, I enticed him with the promise of a sushi dinner. \n\nWe've passed Makiman Sushi endless times but never tried them because I don't like how some of their special rolls are priced (seriously, combinations are not that unique and cost more than at most other places, but in particular you pay waaaaay more for raw - ridiculous considering their slogan is ""Do You Like It Raw?""!). But Makiman is right across the street from the Kimmel and since we had limited time to go from the concert to dinner to a holiday party we went there. \n\nThe servers were really great, very friendly and eager to explain the menu if we had questions. We didn't want to spend too much, which influenced our choices. I had miso soup (fine) and my bf had the pork dumpling soup (yum!). We shared the tuna tartar, which was tasty, and three rolls: blind date, tiger, and a vegetable roll I can't remember. The rolls were fine, nothing special, and the fish quality was good but nothing to squeal over. The rice was kinda...meh...and there was too much of it. With rolls like these, I should be able to fit the whole thing in mouth tiny mouth, but I had to either bite a few in half or remove rice from the exterior. At the end of our meal, my bf turned to me and proclaimed that he never wanted to eat there again. I countered that if we were ever in a group where some wanted sushi and others didn't, Makiman would be a good compromise AND would probably be able to seat a group for sushi, unlike all of the small sushi joints elsewhere. So now I know that we will probably never, ever get sushi from there again, and I can live with that.

I was worried about the cheese for the cheese fries being different because of a recent review I read, but all was good. The fries tasted like they always did.\n\nOne thing I *hate* about this place is that they won't seat you without every member of your party present. So, if 4 out of 7 are here, you won't just seat us at a 7-seat table and let us get some drinks? Or if someone is visibly in the parking lot you won't acknowledge us until they're IN THE DOOR? It's so irritating.\n\nAnyway - the food last night was good. I got the seafood soup. It was pretty spicy, which I wasn't expecting, but luckily I like spice. It also had clams and mussels in the shell. The one thing that disappointed me was that there really wasn't much seafood in the soup. \n\nSomeone I was with got the mussels in marinara - and what came out of the kitchen was gigantic. I'd recommend it if you're hungry.\n\nService was super slow, but they were busy, so I won't complain about it too much.\n\nOverall, this is the go-to place after/before a game, but other than that I wouldn't be making any efforts to make the trip.",2012-02-12,16:01:34

It was blazing hot out, so we wanted to go somewhere with air conditioning where there wouldn't be a wait. Jon's met our needs.\n\nI have to say, I was really surprised by our meal. I got the southwest panini and he got the veggie panini. We each ate half of the other's sandwich, and both panini's were declicious. Like, surprisingly good. The southwest one came with this spicy mayo that I couldn't get enough of. The portion size was PERFECT, which has recently become important to me. We each finished everything on our plates and didn't leave feeling disgustingly stuffed.\n\nOn another note, we opted for salads instead of fries or chips, mostly because there were about 15 dressing choices and several piqued my interest. I got the Asian ginger, and it was one of the best dressings I've ever had. He got the pineapple mango, which was decent, but didn't compare to mine.\n\nThe one thing that really disappointed me, aside from the unsually loud atmosphere, was the drinks. I got a peach margarita and it tasted just like peach schnapps. It didn't seem fresh or natural at all. I then opted for a raspberry margarita, and it tasted like grape soda. Yuck.

Everything on the plate was battered and fried. The only thing I really liked from this appetizer was the Harabhara Kabab (spinach ball). Yes, that was deep fried as well, but it wasn't coated like a McDonald's chicken nugget, like the rest of the things on the plate. I mean, really, you take a potato slice and deep fry it? That's it? No, thanks.\n\nFor our entrees we got the Tandoori Mixed Grill and the Panir Masala (note that I actually ORDERED the Palak Panir, which is a spinach-based dish, but what came out was the Panir Masala, a tomato-based dish). We also got some garlic naan.\n\nI didn't love the Tandoori Mixed Grill as much as my husband did. I really liked the chicken, but I couldn't get on board with the lamb (it was ground lamb, and to me, it looked like sausage). The shrimp was also pretty tough to chew.\n\nI have to say that my favorite part of the entire meal was dipping the garlic naan into the Panir Masala. While I wasn't super fond of the cheese cubes in the sauce (because of the texture), they were OK in moderation. The flavors, though, with the garlic naan and the tomato sauce...mmmm, that was good.\n\nSo, in the end, dinner was OK overall, with three components combining to make two stand-out dishes (the spinach balls and the tomato based cheese cube dish/garlic naan).

The buttermilk pie was delicious, refreshing, and light, whereas the gooey cluster thing was super heavy and rich.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my meal here, but my main gripe has to do with the cost of everything. This is a ""small plates"" restaurant with regular plate prices. Everyone out with us agreed that the cost for the food was really way too much, and we wouldn't return based on that alone. I know there are tons of other tapas restaurants where you can get the same amount of food for a fraction of the cost. The ambiance (lighting, decor, mis-matched fine China serve wear) was great, and the service was good, but neither of those things make up for the cost of these tiny dishes.",2016-05-16,15:01:27

I just finished my meal and can't even wait until tomorrow morning to write the review! This is definitely not the answer to our lack of Chinese and sushi restaurants.\n\nAll of the food here was absolutely flavorless, served in heaping portions, and mushy. \n\nThe egg roll was seriously filled with kimchi. The inside was pink and tasted like vinegar. When I asked my husband what he thought of it he couldn't put his finger on the weird flavor. When I suggested it tasted like kimchi he was like YES!\n\nThe beef with broccoli and the lo mein both tasted like MSG and nothingness. My husband referred to the lo mein as ""brown noodles.""\n\nThe wonton soup was the only marginally edible thing here, but you don't get much in your order, so there's that. \n\nThe sushi was worse than grocery store sushi. The seaweed wrap was in edible in that you couldn't chew it! It wouldn't break up in my mouth. It just basically un-rolled itself while I was chewing. \n\nThe water (yes I'm about to talk about tap water) tasted like plastic. Maybe it was the glass (which wasn't made of glass)? Who knows. \n\nThe waitress was very nice and said ""thank you"" after every sentence, but she messed up my order and brought me house lo mein instead of just pork. Also, the credit card system is very odd and we didn't get a receipt. \n\nThis joint would be great for beer and convenience store offerings. Please, don't make the mistake we did and eat here.

The one thing that I will remember about the food is not the taste, plating, or options - it's the portion size. When I say that the portions are gigantic I really mean it. I could have eaten two lunches and a dinner from the plate of food I was given. The pasta + meat dishes (like the chicken and sausage scallopini and chicken marsala) were especially large. I'm actually deducting a star simply because the portions were too damn big and I don't like restaurants that don't have the right portion sizes.

Because I work, I couldn't be there to recieve the items. My sister-in-law graciously agreed to be there to receive the items when the delivery men came.\n\nMy window of delivery was 11:30-3:30 (yes, that's four hours in the middle of a weekday). When I was told my delivery time I informed the woman who called me that I was told that I could receive a phone call from the driver of the truck when they were an hour away. She said to me, ""Well, you have to REQUEST that. Are you REQUESTING that?""\n\nReally? REALLY? Yes, of course I'm requesting it. Jesus!\n\nAt 11:30 I received a call telling me that the truck was ""five minutes"" away. I told the driver that my sister-in-law was driving to my house to receive the items for me and that it'd take her 30 minutes to get there, and that I was told that the phone call would be placed when they were an hour away. He said that everything was fine and he still had some stuff to do at the house he was at previous to mine, so it should all work out perfectly.\n\nAN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES LATER they show up. Yes, they showed up an hour and ten minutes later, after they told me on the phone that they were just a few minutes away. Perhaps they got lunch? No big deal, but perhaps you could have told me that so my sister didn't rush to get there just to wait for another 40 minutes.\n\nAnyway, my SIL said that the driver and the crew were all very nice and friendly, but that the mattress I ordered was the wrong size. This shocked me as my husband and I had an extensive conversation with Neil regarding why we were purchasing this mattress, what it would be used for, and what size the bed frame was. \n\nAt this point I called the store and asked to speak with a manager. After the lies we were told about the delivery process, I was fed up with things not working out with my order. I was told that there was no manager I could speak with, but that I was going to be transferred to Paul. I do not know what Paul's role in the store is, but that's who they put me through to.\n\nPaul was friendly enough and assured me that he would take care of the situation. He told me that he tried to call the driver but got no answer, so he had me tell my sister-in-law to tell the driver that he should take the wrong-sized mattress with him and to not leave it at my house.\n\nPaul told me he'd call me back with a plan. This was at about 1:30. I received no phone call from him for the rest of the day, and when I called back to speak with him today I was told that he was off today. Thanks for telling me that yesterday, Paul.\n\nI again requested to speak to a manager. Honestly every time I've called I've asked to speak with a manager, but they are always coincidentally not around. I spoke with Dee, who was also nice enough, but really had no power to fix the situation for me. She said she was going to look to see if they had my mattress in stock in the size I wanted, and she asked if I wanted to continue to wait on hold or if I wanted to receive a call back. I asked if I would be getting a call back today and she assured me I would.\n\nIn the meantime, a few hours pass, and I call my husband and tell him the situation. We both decide that we're going to return the mattress, get a refund, and go down to the Sleepy's literally a few blocks from our house and get an appropriately sized mattress ourselves.\n\nWhen I called Dee back to tell her I wanted a refund, she tells me that the manager is now in the store, but he's in a meeting and will call me back later today.\n\nFinally the manager (Waseem?) calls me back. He's apparently not been briefed at all about my situation,  and let's just say that the conversation deteriorated very, very quickly. I held my temper during the eight (at least) previous calls I made to this place, and unfortunately for this guy I just couldn't contain my rage anymore. After a non-productive conversation where he clearly didn't want to give me a refund I ended up having my husband call to deal with it.\n\nMy husband got the same run around that I did, and it wasn't until he whipped out the ""I'm a lawyer"" card that the guy agreed to refund our money. \n\nI should have known when we were not charged tax on our items even though we live in PA (and that's where they delivered our items to) that this business had some sketchy practices. They clearly don't give a shit about keeping their word to their clients and I hope they go out of business so other people aren't put in the position to deal with their madness.

We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little ""hidden.""  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nSo, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.\n\nFinally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him ""long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.""\n\nSo, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).\n\nAnyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):\n\nTuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.\n\nBacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.\n\nGarlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was ""this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.\n\nChicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.\n\nIt might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.\n\nLike any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.\n\nWhen we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.

At times, I think she wasn't sure what to do next when more patrons came in, so hopefully she'll get a better handle on how things flow.\n\n2) Food -- they serve all their menu items all day, so seeing the short rib hash with poached eggs, I knew what I was getting. It was served with a popover and Bearnaise sauce. It was pretty good (the eggs were poached perfectly), but there was enough delay between the food being prepared and getting to our table that the food was a tad above lukewarm (and even worse, the sauce began to set in places). That was a bummer. I also ordered a side of the cheesy grits which must have had an entire wheel of Gouda in them. Way overbearing.\n\nMy accompanying latte was good, though it took a bit for it to show up.\n\nErin had the short rib sloppy joe (which on the menu says ""joes"", which implied slider-sized to us, it's not -- expect a big kaiser-sized bun). I have to note that this was a disappointment. This was a far away from a sloppy joe as there is -- it was more like a chopped short rib sandwich (pretty much, the meat matched my dish exactly in preparation) with a light sauce mixed in. The onion straws were fine but her accompanying tabbouleh was a disappointment (we saw an order of fries that looked pretty damn awesome. Next time, go for fried foods).\n\n3) Atmosphere -- in the noontime daylight, I can't say I approve. The floor is ""rustic"" (nice way of saying that it looks like it wasn't fixed up) and the overall color scheme is ""out of date appliance avocado green."" In the main dining room, there are booths along the walls, with a number of individual tables and chairs in the middle (while the chair sets at each table appeared to match, none of them matched the rest). Sorry, but it made me think ""what exactly is 'plush' about Plush?""\n\nI just don't know -- if we lived/worked in the area, I'm sure we'd make a point to have a second visit, but considering we do not (and live music isn't our thing), I don't see us coming back, at least no time in the immediate future.",2012-01-06,20:15:00

In a case where ""more should be more"" instead, all those intense flavors we had at SLeeK sort of melted together into a really good, but not anything amazing burger.

It has a lot of positive qualities, but there's also plenty of negatives. I've been here twice with the beautiful wife, so it's time to write a review. Rather than writing some gripping story, let's just hit some points. I'll also say that this could have just as easily been a 4 star review. But for the price, I'll keep it at three.\n\nThe Good:\n1) We've only been here in the evening for dinner, but service has been really good. We've also sat upstairs both times (more about that later). We also appreciated a visit by Gene Bailey (manager and brother of owner Dave), where we were able to give some feedback\n\n2) The two burgers that I've had (PB&J (pesto, goat cheese, tomato jam on a bison patty) and the Ozark (Ozark mushrooms, caramelized onions, and goat cheese) have both been great. Lots of lots with a good amount of toppings\n\n3) The flavor of the shakes -- we've had the Irish Coffee (delicious) and the Sweet Sweet Bacon (bourbon, candied bacon, salted\ncaramel ice cream). If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, you'll remember Vincent commenting about the $5 milkshake. Do they put bourbon in this one? Oh yes they do. And is this a good milkshake? Nay, it's a a pretty fucking good milkshake\n\n4) The beer list -- they're keeping it mostly local and there are some excellent beers on tap\n\n5) The house made pickles and catsup, the fries, the smoked onion rings -- I enjoyed all of them\n\nThe ""not so good"":\n\n1) Price -- especially if you enjoy alcoholic beverages, you can rack up some stupid bills. The two times we've been there we've ended up with hefty bills (with tip, over $90 each time). I guess if you're a ""let's split a burger, an order fries, and have one soda each"" type of couple, you'll be able to walk out of there for $20. But, you're not much fun either. So live with that.\n\n2) The consistency of the shakes -- I'd put the Irish Coffee shake up there with anything that Kota or the Fountain offers, but at Bailey's Range, they're just too thin. I know that Kota bought some uber shake machine, and while I'm not buying one for them, at some point, they should upgrade\n\n3) The cheese curds -- I like cheese curds, but admittedly, I expected fried cheese curds. Instead, these are fresh. So Wisconsinites, you've been warned.\n\n4) The rest of the alcoholic drink menu -- just haven't been a fan of anything the beautiful wife has ordered. For instance, The Bermuda is pretty much a Dark & Stormy with passion fruit nectar. But as presented, all you tasted was the passion fruit. Other drinks tasted more fruity/light, but then again, when you've gotten used to drinking mixtologist concoctions all the time, it's probably my palate.\n\n5) The Carolina burger (topped with smoked pork shoulder,\nhouse bbq sauce, sweet & spicy slaw) was so drenched in BBQ sauce that you couldn't taste anything else. The sauce was wonderful, but if you really want this burger, get the sauce on the side so you can moderate the amount you put on.\n\nI really want to love Bailey's Range -- but that doesn't mean that I hate it. More that I was hoping it would be a place where we'd go on a Tuesday night when we don't feel like cooking. Instead, it feels more like a ""we'll come here once a month.""",2011-10-31,00:42:39

I also, just on a whim, checked their Twitter and saw they took credit/debit cards with Square.\n\nThere was a line of four people in front of me, and maybe 3-5 people waiting for their food.  The orders went quickly, then much to my disappointment, I first saw a sign saying they only take credit cards for orders of $15 or more and the menu had changed (the wife wanted their quarter chicken platter, which is no more).\n\nI went with a Cuban and a three taco platter (pork, short rib, and chicken).  Originally I had wanted the curried sweet potato, but they were out of that (which basically meant vegetarians were screwed.  Maybe they have a salad but really, who wants to always eat salad?)  Both platters, I believe, mentioned having beans (which I was hoping for the corn), and the Cuban also mentioned an ""orange.""\n\nAnd despite my bill coming out to ""only"" $14.50, they still allowed me to use my credit card.

Obviously, I had not read Jen H.'s review and thought these were going to be closer to traditional (lime/cilantro).\n\nI will add that the fellow who took my order was nice, though a bit rushed.

The same person who designed Lucas Park Grille designed this space, so there's a nice modern, but comfy feel about it.\n\nNow, on to why this place is multifaceted:\n\n1) They serve breakfast (including Saturdays and Sundays at 8AM!!!)\n\n2) They are a coffee bar\n\n3) They serve lunch (sandwiches and salads)\n\n4) They have meat and cheese platters and other small plates such as hummus, roasted olives, etc.\n\n5) They have a fairly decent wine list\n\n6) They have martinis/cocktails\n\n7) Because of #2 and #6, they have boozy coffee drinks\n\nThat's covering a lot of bases (Yelp's limit of three categories was problematic). I did read an article in Feast that they might have at least one entree at some point, but I do not recall seeing anything in the thick book of a menu.\n\nSpeaking of the menu, everything pretty much has some ""cute"" name, with drinks seeming to have a heavy focus on classic Hollywood stars. I'll gripe and say that it felt a little silly ordering a Betty Grable (nice gams (1)).\n\nSpeaking of the Betty Grable, that's exactly what I ordered -- 10 Cane rum, amaretto, pineapple juice, and...maybe something else? It was pretty good, but it was soon taken over by Erin because she ordered some spiced apple drink that was not good (10 Cane rum again, apple juice, cinnamon). It tasted way too watery/weird. I eventually moved over to a nice Zin (Hess Artezin)\n\nOn a quick tangent, popovers and their derivative are found throughout the menu. If you don't know what a popover here, here you go: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popovers.\n\nI ordered some sandwich that was turkey, avocado, bacon, mayo (I think), and sunflower pesto. For the bread, because I have fond memories of my mother's popovers, I asked for that (it's an option per the menu, though I wasn't asked -- service still has some kinks).\n\nThe sandwich was fine -- the components tasted like how they were supposed to and thankfully, even in the dim lighting, I could see that the avocado was nice and green. The popover was problematic -- first off, compared to every other popover I've had in my lifetime, this one appeared to have been baked long ago and had gotten a bit hard. Second, the ""top"" of the popover part of the sandwich was absolutely huge, so the only way to eat this was to smush it down to a bitable width. The accompanying chips were (I believe) Billy Goat.\n\nErin had the chicken salad, which when she writes a review, she can tell you more about. In summary she did say to me ""this is really good chicken salad.""\n\nSo, let's go over some thoughts about the place:\n\n1) We're absolutely coming back here for breakfast.\n\n2) The current lack of entrees makes this more of a ""grab a quick bite"" place at night _or_ it's a wine bar.\n\n3) The prices for food is pretty reasonable (around $8-9 for everything) and the small plate prices looked decent as well.\n\n4) But the drink prices? Way too much. The martinis were $10 each and my wine was $9 a glass. It's _way_ too much for non-mixologist cocktails and for a wine that normally retails around $16-18, again, way too pricey.\n\nTheir web site is just a ""coming soon"" placeholder, so you can read more at: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Blondies-Coffee-and-Wine-Bar/128851093863245. No menu available online (yet)\n\nNow it's time for the verdict -- obviously, you've seen that I've given them 3 stars, so I'm OK with the place. I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast and coffee, but as a nightspot, right now the prices for drinks are too high -- I hope at some point they'll have happy hours specials, because I'd love to go back and try their small plate offerings.\n\n\n(1) You're either going huh? or you remember this scene http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv-5flYewm8.",2011-11-09,15:13:32

Maybe at best $0.02 less, but otherwise, prices were virtually the same (or in the case of litter, I think it was actually a little more).\n\nIf you want/need to feed you pet organic/specialty food, then I can see why you go here.

I just don't know about this place -- I've walked out of there going ""two stars, not going back!"" to well, going back and thinking ""four stars, can't wait to come here again!""\n\nSo I'm going with three stars -- there's consistently been enough positives and negatives that they balance out.\n\nHere's a series of thoughts:\n\n1) I like the pinxtos at happy hour (bar area only) -- if you're feeling cheap and/or looking for something to nibble on before moving to another destination, you can get a lot of food for fairly cheap.\n\n2) But, some of the items aren't that great. I'd say that if you see something has aioli on it, chances are, it's going to be pretty tasteless. As the beautiful wife noted in her review, the mushrooms, oysters, and chicken wings are all solid.\n\n3) The happy hour drink specials are OK -- I wish that they'd offer specials on their regular wines by the glass, but that's just me. The Spanish beers they have are by the bottle and are both lighter (I believe a lager and a pilsner). The funniest thing they offer is the $2.50 half pint for draft beer. Maybe that's some traditional thing in Spain, but good lord, it just screams ""stupid.""\n\n4) Dish of note: the Bistec a la Cabrales (grilled hanger steak with Cabrales cheese and port reduction) -- this was delicious. The steak was perfectly done and the sweetness of the reduction balanced out the cheese nicely. And you get a pretty decent-sized portion for $8.00\n\n5) Service has ranged from friendly to indifferent. Indifferent made one happy hour not so happy. Why so gloomy? Maybe it's all the cheap people who come in and order 10 millions things for $8? Buck up camper, you could be working at another establishment on the Hill and poisoning people with Provel.\n\n6) Lots of parking in their own lot and/or the street.\n\n7) Cocktails -- the coconut caipirinha is wacky delicious. The rest of the cocktail menu is heavy on sweet drinks, so I've just stuck with beer and wine.\n\nThough I know we'll visit here again, I'll always be skeptical of what experience we're about to have...",2011-11-18,17:42:49

I was never really a huge fan of grunge back in the day, and out of the grunge bands, I really had zero use for Soundgarden.\n\nWhere am I going with this? Well, Soundgarden sang a little earworm titled ""Black Hole Sun"" and every time I've seen a review of Black Thorn Pub, I get that effing song stuck in my head. And it bugs the hell out of me.\n\nBut, I didn't hold that against them, because I surprised the beautiful wife with a visit to BTP because I was in a pizza mood. So off we went.\n\nTime for il buono, il brutto, il cattivo:\n\nIl Buono:\n\n1) Really friendly service. While service here means going up to the bar to order and pick up food and drink, the people I dealt with were super nice.\n\n2) Guinness -- yes, I'm easily pleased with it comes to placing having Guinness, but BTP gets extra points because they pulled a really nice pint\n\n3) Land of the Provel free and the home of the brave.\n\n4) Ignore all the complaints about smoking in past reviews -- maybe there's residual nicotine stuck in the woodwork, but it's non-smoking now.\n\nIl brutto:\n\n1) It's a dive more than a ""pub"" so expect the dark and dingy. And the lack of table service is sort of annoying, especially when you just want a beer and there's a group of eight people standing in line.\n\n2) The wine -- not that I'd order wine here, but all they appeared to have were dusty little bottles of Sutter Hill. Just a warning.\n\n3) The pizza -- Allan C., you magnificent bastard, I read your review! This is indeed Pizza Hut on steroids. Because I love pizza (and wanted leftovers for days), we went with a large pan with a bunch of toppings -- in retrospect, a mistake of huge proportions (literally). This pizza is giant, and as reviewers have noted, there's both a crap load of crust (I can't even imagine the deep dish) and the sauce tasted like the ratio of tomato to spice is 1:1. It wasn't horrible, but it's almost impossible to eat cold without blowing out your TMJ.\n\nIl cattivo:\n\n1) Honestly, I don't have much to complain about except the speaker that they use to tell you that your pizza is ready ought to be featured on the eventual ""It's a Pizza at a Dive Bar, Charlie Brown"" animated special. They'd be better off screaming your name from the bar.\n\nIf we lived in the area, I'm sure we'd make this a regular place, but, we don't.

After getting dicked over by Hard Rock, we went to Landry's.  My first though on entering was ""I feel underdressed"" -- then I remembered, I'm a tourist, I can do whatever I want.\n\nThe beautiful wife and I started off with seafood stuffed jalapenos, which were awkward at best.

Better than Red Lobster, worse than just about any other seafood place.  But the scallops on this platter were excellent.  And apparently, I ate ""Pontchartrain"" but based on what other reviewers have written, this is Tilapia or a related poop-eating fish.

Get real, son.)\n\nHere's another late-night review by yours truly.\n\nSo, not being from the St. Louis metropolitan area, my husband and I never fully understood the hype surrounding this place, or frozen custard in general. Kind of like provel cheese or the Cardinals. Having lived in Southern IL for awhile, our options were limited, and we typically were only able to get our hands on custard.\n\nNow that we've moved into the city of St. Louis, we have access to delicious ice creams and gelatos. I thought we'd never go back to custard again, especially not to a custard-serving establishment that was some traditional Cardinal fan haven.\n\nBut for some reason last night, I thought it would be nice to go to Ted Drewes. The weather was only a little chilly and we thought it might be nice to take our dog out for a joy ride. And I was kind of feeling like a nostalgic St. Louisan. The St. Louis feels are overtaking my body and that scares me.\n\nI don't know why I even wanted to go. The last (and really only) time I remember going, I ordered the cookie sandwich, which was -- in a word -- disgusting. I think I have to chalk that up to the fact that Dad's Cookies (oatmeal) taste like hell. In fact, they all taste like hell. But that's another review for another time.\n\nI ordered another simple pleasure this time, a.k.a. not a sundae or concrete with gobs of hot fudge, peanut butter cups, etc. Which, don't get me wrong, I love. I just wasn't feeling it last night. So I ordered three scoops of custard dipped in chocolate in a cake cone. Simple AND inexpensive, this treat will run you about $2.50. In the overpriced world of frozen confections, this is considered a steal.\n\nBest dipped cone I have ever eaten, as far as dipped cones go. Mostly because I'm used to the dipped cones at Dairy Queen where the ""ice cream"" runs like diarrhea. And even though Ted Drewes only has one flavor of custard (vanilla...boring), it was still the best custard I've tried. Would it kill them to serve chocolate as a flavor, though?\n\nI ended up feeding the bottom part of the cone to our dog (no signs of chocolate anywhere...back off, PETA). It was probably the best thing that has happened to him, short of getting adopted. Then again, he eats his own vomit, so I'm not sure it was an indication of anything.\n\nI don't know whether to rate this a 3 or a 5. It's a 5, in terms of custard and a 3, in terms of frozen confections. Might even be a 2, as the place was packed and rife with Cardinals fans. Since I'm feeling generous, I'll give it 3 stars.\n\nNext time, we'll probably just bite the bullet and muster up enough energy to drive to the Clayton Rd. Schnucks, park, walk in, and order some delicious Benitos gelato. Now THAT is good eats.",2013-04-14,09:31:48

I figured it couldn't be that bad, and I'm sorry to say I was wrong.\n\nI'll start with the good. It was a hip, attractive place, with a dining room and a nice bar. I walked in alone a little before 2:00 this past Saturday and had the whole bar to myself. The bartender was very warm and welcoming, and he whipped me up a Bloody Mary. This was solid, made with vodka, house Bloody Mary mix, wasabi, and Angostura. Savory with a nice kick.\n\nThe food, though, was no good. I was on alert as soon as I saw the menu, which was full of ""creative"" Asian fusion shit that all sounded complicated in a way that wasn't even remotely intriguing. I ended up getting the niku udon, which came with mushroom broth, braised wagyu beef shoulder, Chinese spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and fish cake. It was so bad it was actually a little bit racist (the brunch here is called ""brunchuru"" by the way, which is not Japanese but is very much like the fake Japanese in the Iron Chef episode of Futurama). The broth was thick and overpowering, like a liquefied fajita, and there was a kale garnish, which like, why? The noodles were fine, as was the fish cake, and I did like the ajitama I added, a lovely flavored soft-boiled egg. I did the best I could to rescue it from falling into the broth. I couldn't do the same for the udon.\n\nIt turned out, incidentally, that I didn't have time to eat here, as I was supposed to be moderating a panel that started at 2:00 almost a mile away. The start time had changed (it was in my calendar as 3:00) and I wasn't notified until my friend texted me, at which point I settled up and rushed over to the conference site to arrive halfway through the panel. In the confusion, I lost a brand new pair of expensive sunglasses.

First of all, if you are going to have a special menu and close down all the other parts of your menu, don't lie about it.  When we call, tell us about it, put it on your website, and don't tell us that everything will be available when it's not.  \n\nHad the single most sub-par experience in a restaurant in stl.  The staff was definitely the B-list.  The service was atrocious.  Who in their right mind announces your wine price so that every other patron can hear? That is, after you rummage through a closet on top of us searching for the wine, can't find it, and just chose another and told us precisely how much it cost in an out-door voice.  Thanks, we came here to be judged by the other patrons, whose heads all visibly swiveled at the announcement. \n\nAlso, who runs out of bread? And if you DO run out of bread, why would you leave the bread plate, butter knife, and other bread service accoutrements out?\n\nAnd, upcharging for beef (not even filet mignon - short ribs and something else not expensive) just seems to be nickle-and diming.  It's not lobster. It's not even filet, and not, god forbid Kobe or Wagyu.  It's shortribs for crying out loud!\n\nRunning out of half the menu is bad.  Especially at 8pm. Having the rest of that menu be less than tasty is also bad.  It was also clear that SOME of the menu items in the stuff they had was running out and they were trying to save up.\n\nPart of the reason this is truly unacceptable is that for Valentine's Day you have reservations - 100% booked reservations WEEKS before V-Day.  If you can't order correctly when you know exactly how many patrons will be in, that's a problem.  It's a problem when the service is so bad the waiter apologizes at the end of it.  It's a problem when everything tastes like it was sort of nuked because you have you B-game here.  I understand Vday is a captive audience, but come on - we certainly won't be back and we certainly won't be entertaining guests here again.

Half the menu items weren't even in the realm of Greece. \n\nIt was also expensive.  I might have been more accomodating if the food was good, but it was not.  It was downright awful. \n\nThe taramousalata was cold potato salad with not fresh fish roe.  This is not taramousalata.  The hummus was salty, and the other dips were equally poor.  Lamb chops were pretty good, but how hard is it to screw up lamb if it's not overcooked?  Especially baby lamb chops.\n\nGrilled octopus was boiled squid.

Like Kayleigh's rep, Stephanie was polite and friendly, but overstayed her welcome. She arrived at 6P (on time), but didn't leave until close to 8:30P. It was overly salesy and drawn out (and I work in Sales). I have a toddler who goes to bed at 8P. That was fun. I didn't mind limited options, in a way it makes it easier for me, but I do wish I had a bit more to choose from.\n\nWe selected our items and scheduled the install for 4/20 (hardwood) and 4/21 (carpet). Stephanie indicated we had to do hardwood first THEN carpet. No problem! \n\nThe Saturday prior, I received an email from Empire saying *I* had to call to confirm my appointment. I thought that to be a bit strange considering the amount of $ I was spending. I felt they should call me to confirm like most places to do, but I shrug it off and call in. \n\nI call in and placed on hold for about 15 minutes. I then tell the operator I was confirming my 2 installs. He indicated I couldn't confirm the carpet install (on the 21st) as their system didn't go ""that far out"". I asked why, but he couldn't say. I asked if there was a way he could include a note on my file that I confirm so I don't have to call back in. Nope. Not an option. I call back in Monday and after being placed on hold again, confirm. I was told they could call me the morning of my installs with a time frame.\n\nPlease keep in mind my husband and I both took time off from work to sit home and wait for the project to be complete.\n\nOn the 20th, they call me at 7:50AM. Debbie tells me that we have the best installer and how fantastic he is. Our time frame is 11A-2P, but he'll be there earlier because he's so fast and amazing! Wonderful. Debbie says the installer will call me on his way over. He was working on a job about 30 minutes from our home.\n\n11A rolls around, nothing. 12P, nothing. 1P, nothing. 1:55P, crickets. As I'm calling Empire to see what is going on, they're calling me on behalf of the installer. He was held up on his morning job and running very late as he was still working. He said he would like to give me a new time frame of 3P-5P. I'd asked the operator how he could possibly be there at 3P if he was still working and 30 minutes away. \n\nLong story short - the call with the operator was a slight battle. They wanted to do the install that evening after I made it clear 1.) I have toddler and 2.) I work full-time. You're not working until 11P outside of our rooms. Sorry. He claimed he was trying to work with me, then got annoyed we couldn't take more time off of work to get this done. I'm sorry - we don't have that luxury, sir. He then tells me the installer guaranteed a morning install for us on Thursday to get the floors in before the carpet, then when I repeated what he'd say, he retracted it saying they never guarantee installs. He told me *I* had to call in to see where the installer was at 8A the next morning......\n\nThe outcome of the call was the install would take place the next day, Thursday, when the carpet was due to be installed anyway. At that point, I didn't trust them, but threw my hands up.\n\n(We call our rep to see if she can assist/provide insight at 2:30P on Wednesday. We're still waiting on her call - it's been almost a week.)\n\nThe next morning, Debbie calls me at 7:20A while I'm driving to work to say my window is 8A-11A.\n\n8:09A - my phone rings. The installer is there. \n\nMy husband arrives home 2 minutes later from dropping our son at school to find the hardwood AND carpet installers there. The guys go in to get to work. The hardwood guys pull up the carpet. Lo and behold we have hardwood. Our rep, Stephanie, NEVER PULLED UP THE CARPET TO CHECK TO SEE WHAT WAS UNDERNEATH. This is our first home, our first install. We wouldn't have known what to check for. Now, the hardwood installer had to call CORPORATE to get a quote on hardwood floor removal. SEETHING.\n\nThe installers were fantastic. I'll give them that. They worked quickly and efficiently - communicated everything to my husband the entire way. But my rep? The main office? HORRIBLE. They are overpriced and don't give a hoot about the consumer.

I answered yes, but shouldn't she know if she works there? I scratched my head, but didn't think much of it. We were sent paperwork prior to our appointment. Cool - less time waiting!  \n\nA week prior to our appointment, they call to say my husband isn't covered & would have to pay out of pocket for his exam. I called back & assured them he was. They double checked, saw I was correct, and said ""Oh, our mistake. Don't worry. You're fine."" \n\nOur appointment was for 10A on a Saturday morning. We were taken in right away! The assistant takes us back for the various tests. She asks if we were there for contacts. I said yes. She says ""let's forget the tests"" & brought us into an exam room. On my paperwork, I had indicated that glaucoma ran in my family.Shouldn't I be at LEAST given a glaucoma test? Yes, I should have said something, but trusted them since they're the eye doctor. My mistake. \n\nOver the next 2 hours we rotated in & out of the chair and the exam room. The doctor left us (he was literally looking at my eye, turned around, & walked out) to take care of another patient. We were put back into the waiting room for about 20 minutes - TWICE. Why? I don't know.\n\nThe doctor doesn't make one mention of the large bump on my husband's eye & our eyes were dilated without warning/prior knowledge. He put the drops in, then told us what it was. Um. How were we supposed to drive home? We couldn't see well at all. It was too late to say anything.\n\nMy prescrip changed pretty dramatically, yet I was told to put my old contacts in .... after my eyes were dilated. The contacts were then stained yellow from the drops. On top of not being able to see from the dilation, I couldn't see through my contacts because they were discolored. In all my years of eye exams, I was always given a fresh pair of contacts with the new prescription. Am I missing something?\n\nMy husband's left contact had been bothering him the month leading up to our appointment. But he had to wear his contacts to drive. The prescrip in his glasses was over 10 years old. The contacts were more recent. The doctor noted how irriated his eye was from it. He held it up to a flashlight & saw that it was coated in debris that couldn't be removed. His vision changed as well. Guess what? He was told to put his old contacts in too. Now I opened my mouth & asked for a trial pair for him. Unreal.\n\nOur exam is finally over & we head out to order contacts & new glasses. We have VSP, so we get a $150 credit to use toward new glasses OR towards the contact lens exam/contacts. Our choice, yet, we weren't given an option. We were told to pay for the lens fitting. I was confused, but since we were going to use the $150 toward glasses, we didn't think much of it. We pay & wait to get new glasses. And we wait.... and wait... and wait..... The female employee tells us to pick out frames, it would be a little bit of a wait (there were 2 people being helped & 2 folks in front of my husband & I). We tell them we have our old frames & just need the lenses done. We take a seat & wait 45 minutes. Not one person had moved. The team was slow as molasses. Now we were there going on 2.5 hours, so we leave.\n\nAfter all that, we didn't even order contacts. Yet, 2 weeks after my husband receives a message saying his contacts are ready. They ordered without approval. THEN told him that I gave the OK to max out my $150 to buy contacts. I never said that.\n\nAWFUL. Never again will I go back.

Actually, when they closed off the patio (due to shifting more staff over to this newer location), that's when you could tell where the focus was.

The prices here are typical for hibachi I think.

Also, I'm not sure if Hilary P requested miso specifically... but everytime I've gone to a Benihana, they usually serve onion soup as part of the combo deal.  I got the hibachi steak - delicious and large pieces, unlike some other ones I've gone to.  Also, not sure if it was a promo or what, but everyone at the table got a free sample of shrimp.  As far as sushi goes, it was actually quite good.\n\nService was alright... my only complaint was that she brought out my spicy tuna roll towards the end of the meal, and didn't really bother until AFTER I asked about it.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in, was how huge this place was. It's not at all what I expected from the outside. With all the space in the restaurant, they didn't do a good job at filling it. It feels very empty, and cold. \n\nNow for the service. I honestly think our waitress chugged two Five Hour Energy's, and four Red Bulls before she came to our table! She had a heavy Asian accent and was talking a mile a minute. She tried to go over the lunch specials with me, and by tried I mean she flipped through my menu quickly and banged on a few pages. There were some things that were two for one and some things that were half priced, but which was which was a total guess. Between the time she brought out our drinks and when we ordered was probably fifteen minutes. And in those fifteen minuted we determined that their sushi menu was extremely over priced when compared to other Sushi joints in the city.    \n\nSo for lunch we both stuck to the Hibachi menu. I ordered the steak and L ordered the shrimp. Both tasted alright, but it was nothing great. I ordered a side of fried rice that tasted like I was eating a stick of butter. I added some soy sauce to it, but then it just tasted like I was eating a stick of salted butter. I asked for the steak medium rare and it came out medium well, emphasis on the well. But, when the steak is cut into cubes the size of dice, it's hard to cook then to any other consistency other than well.\n\nThankfully the Hibachi menu was 50% off, it was one of the specials that our hopped up waitress banged on when we first arrived, so lunch was only 12 bucks between the two of us.

Haven't tried too much of the food, but have had the wraps and am waiting to still try the dosas.  Given that I my roots are from the south of India, I must say that I tend to have very high expectations for the dosa clan of food items which is quite different from North Indian food (naans etc.)\n\nNow, what I have tried I really ilke.  They make an awesome Himalayan chai which is green in color.  Strongly infused with crushed pistachios, extremely flavorful and filling.  It's caffeine free too.  It's really more like flavored milk.   I also like some of the other things out there.  They have a large variety of tea bags that you can pick up for your hot tea.\n\nRemedy has some seriously filling muffins etc. to go with tea/coffee for those just looking for the cafe experience.  Mostly whole grain muffins with high fiber and filling as hell, it's great for an afternoon break from work kind of thing.  I like 'em.\n\nThe food looks very good, to be honest.  I can't wait to try some of the things.  Dosa is one, but even some of the more traditional north indian varieties look pretty good.

The ambience is lovely, located in the high-ceilinged Mercer building in the warehouse district.  Charming interiors, quite beautiful furniture, intriguing wall art, Edison-era light installations and what not.  They might have the best ambience any cafe in Edmonton has.  Perfect date place too, I think, with decent music playing and comfortable furniture for quiet conversations.\n\nI've been here twice and agree with most reviewers in that they make interesting latte creations and teas.   I think they briefly had a caramel-bacon latte which sounds really interesting and I enjoyed their salted caramel latte.  They have a collection of craft beers and wines mainly from AB and the Okanagan region.  It's interesting and I'm glad they support local craft brews and wines, though at least on the beer front, these regions are not known for the best craft brews in Canada.\n\nWhy the 3 stars? Many might consider me a coffee snob when I say this, but I actually think that for $5, it's only fair that the quality of the actual espresso be far better than something you would get at a chain coffee shop.  This, however, they lack in.  The staff seem to know very little about actual coffee and how to make a good espresso and this disappoints me a little.  It's got a bit of a yuppie feel to it without delivering a quality product.  \n\nI am not sure if I will go back because I know of places that make better coffee. There are many in Edmonton now (Elm, Transcend, Leva, Credo, Sugar Bowl, da Capo etc.) and to open up a new coffee shop and not strive to at least equal the bar set by these establishments, especially when they charge as much (some cases, more) as these other well established coffee joints, is a little disappointing for me.\n\nCome here for an interesting flavored latte, but don't come if you demand high quality coffee.  The main reason for three stars is that they claim to be a coffeehouse first and don't do too well, in my books, on that front.",2012-12-18,03:21:27

While I'm certainly not fond of the ambience, I think that having a good list of beers on tap is a great sign for Edmonton's beer revolution!\n\nFirstly, I was definitely disappointed with the lack of enthusiasm and knowledge of the server.  When you have a one page list of food items and 4 pages of beers, you better well know a bit about beer.   To be honest, I don't blame the server because I actually think she shouldn't be working there.\n\nThe plus points are easy: good variety of beers on tap (I believe 72 taps) to give a fair competition to the industrialized MKT.  I haven't eaten there but I'm glad to see that their menu is just one page and focusses on pub fare.  I also like that their beers are listed by 100s, 200s, 300s and 400s, i.e., representing the spectrum of beer drinkers from the newbies to the experts.  However, with some beers not having the name of their brewery listed, it is confusing if not unacceptable.  Also, not sure how many of those beers are craft beers - but I will let the 400s level 'experts' answer that.\n\nThe negatives are easy too: top 40s music, ambience Moxie-like, servers who know nothing about beer etc.; all attributes pointing towards the typical Edmonton feel, i.e. treading that line of club and lounge poorly.  The word 'underground' should not be confused with something that is metaphorically underground, i.e., grungy feel, a hidden staircase taking you down (unlike the escalator they have), pub-like ambience, wait staff wearing old clothes from Army and Navy and looking like they really need a haircut but being total geeks about beer, etc.  This is the impression I got from the name, which however, The Underground does not possess. \n\nDrop in and enjoy a good beer. Don't expect to be wowed.",2012-10-17,16:47:49

The selection here is excellent.  Most of the produce seems really fresh and with Sunworks Organic being their meat supplier, they're in good hands in the local department. \n\nHowever, the prices here are going to keep me at bay.  Every now and then I might come here to try some of their artisanal cheeses from B.C., but mind you at $11 or so for a 200gm case of goat cheese it would have to be a special occasion.  I wish I could afford to shop here regularly.  \n\nBread comes from Treestone as well as some wood-fired artisanal loafs from bakeries in B.C.  Apparently, they ship the bread 'half done' and the last stage of baking is completed in store. Again, delicious bread that is probably better than what you'd get at most bakeries around town but a tad on the expensive side.\n\nThe fruits and vegetables are probably closer or equal in price to other organic stores.  Definitely consider dropping in for some fresh fruit if you happen to be walking down Whyte.  Try it out and see if it's to your liking.  With a dearth of organic produce in Edmonton, I'm glad that living on/close to Whyte gives us access to a variety of organic shops.",2012-06-15,15:03:20

It's proximity to the UofA campus makes it an ideal destination for people to come here for a lunch or dinner-after-theatre type experience. \n\nAlthough I like the ambience and the menu, which is quite affordable; I have to mention that the maki rolls, sushi and everything else that involved rice, had the long-grain variety of rice.  I'm not an extreme purist of any kind, but given that sushi rice is easily available, I'm surprised that they've gone with the long grain variety.  \n\nIn any case, complaints apart, I like the list of options and of course, as always, the combination plates are easy and convenient to order.  They serve a good green tea with the dinner.  \n\nThe big plus point for this place is its relatively affordable prices and that it is in this revitalized 109th street alcove area around Garneau.

I've not been a very active Remedier - having probably been there about 6 times over the last two years.\n\nThe list of chais that they serve here is an impressive one. While I do enjoy the Kashmiri chai and their regular chai, I happened to have the ginger spiced chai today and was quite disappointed.  In general, I'm not very fond of overly sweet chai but that's something that seems to be sell well, so I do consider Remedy to serve great chai.  However, in the ginger chai the ginger wasn't mixed at all and the drink was just a regular chai till I go to the last two sips that were extremely pungent.  It's okay - it's still a solid 3 star chai. \n\nThe masala dosa, on the other hand was at the far end of the rating spectrum.  I've heard so many Edmontonians speak praises of how good the masala dosa at Remedy is, so I figured I should give it a try.  Now, I'm not one of those Indians who generally expects a lot from Indian restaurants.  Having said that, this dosa I had today was probably the worst rendition of any Indian dish I've had in Canada (thus far).  I say rendition because it is certainly Remedy's interpretation of what a masala dosa is. However, it's an awful interpretation.  The batter had a very weird and rubbery texture. The filling (masala) was an unfortunate stir fry of vegetables that had flavors far from those expected in South Indian food. I was extremely disappointed.  I don't want to get into how bad the chutneys and sauces were.  The whole experience was, coming to think of it, a waste of calorie intake.\n\nI have no clue why they make masala dosas if they're going to make it like this.  All in all, I'll come back but stick to chai.  The wraps and other food is a decent 3 star, but nothing evoking a 'Wow!'.  I understand that Remedy is dear to many and I love that they're an Edmontonian food presence.  I much prefer the chai at 'Chai Pani' on Whyte.",2012-03-24,19:22:43

It's really the Canadian equivalent of Denny's, however Denny's is 24 hours (I actually prefer Denny's!).\n\nThis particular branch of Smitty's is bad because it's not spacious enough to call itself a Family restaurant.  Further, it's quite dimly lit and does not have a comfortable feeling about it.  The waiters aren't particularly helpful which, to be honest, is not their fault - it's a depressing job to work at Smittys!\n\nOne thing I found acceptable was the prices.  Although I'd rather have a breakfast to-go at Starbucks or even Timmy's, both of which would be cheaper, I'd have to say that you could sit at Smitty's and drink their bad coffee and have a cheap meal, spending over an hour and reading the newspaper.\n\nBut that's the faintest of silver lining.

It was held at Fisher's Tudor House on Street Road in Bensalem, which was always the epitome of fine dining in the great northeast, where many years ago I spent my youth.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Fisher's, there used to be several of them. The original was on Castor avenue north of Cottman Avenue and was always quite the place to be. I can remember admiring the huge ancient ship models encased in glass when I was little and my family would make the drive. When I was older, I would have Friday lunch there during work, enjoying the fresh snapper soup and delicious blue cheese dressing. \n\nBut the Tudor House took up the mantle with style. A HUGE facility built (at the time) in the middle of nowhere, it was not only THE seafood restaurant in the area, it had banquet halls for thousands of people, a night club, and everything the fine diner could wish.\n\nReturning to the present, I had arrived early for the party in an effort to beat rush hour traffic. As we talked I realized it had been a good seven years at least since I had last set foot into this facility, so I was looking forward to a trip down memory lane. \n\nWell, as they say, what a long strange trip it's been. We checked in at the front desk of a strangely quiet reception area. The waiting area had a wonderful display of cookies and stuffed animals, but almost appeared to be a gift shop, something out of place among the huge mantles and wallboards decorating the entryways. We passed the wine bins outside one of the main dining rooms and walked into the bar.\n\nMy guest, who smokes like a chimney, was amazed they were ignoring the smoking ban until I reminded him we were in Bensalem. Yours truly, who can smell a pilot light out two houses over, was aghast at the smell of old smoke. No need to bring cigarettes kiddies, just lick a wall. It was like the airport 'smoking rooms' of old. Not even a good wood/leather/smoke mix. Just dirty old smoke.\n\nThe bartended approached us as we sat at the bar (we were the lone patrons as far as the eye could see short of someone who was apparently a dishwasher from the kitchen watching the news), and I ordered a lager while we looked over the bar menu and privately discussed his 80's retro haircut. \n\nLittle did I realize this was a foreshadowing of the night to come, but let's continue.\n\nBMK ordered his typical Malibu and coke and I ordered a half dozen oysters. They were Effingham Bay's, and served in minimum orders of three at $1.50 a piece. \n\nI had switched over to Dirty Skyy Martini's when the oysters arrived. My nose warned me to be careful even as they approached. One sniff and I knew these were off. I tried sniffing each individually but there was no point. BMK remarked that he could smell them and ""if I can smell them, they're really bad."" I agreed and sent them back. They were politely removed from my tab and we continued on, raw bar now on permanent 'avoid' status.\n\nYou can see the menu at their website, but it had truly gone from fine seafood dining to JRZY diner seafood. (And not good JRZY diner seafood, which can be quite nice.) Let me note their advertised 'seafood menu' has only five (yes FIVE) offerings, no lobster (petite lobster tails don't count), and two fresh fish. \n\nWe decided something odd was going on so we quickly drank our drinks, left payment, and walked back out to the entranceway. How shocked was I to see the staff following us out, lights being turned off and doors locked AT NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT!!!. South Jersey isn't this bad on a Sunday night! This was KraZinEss!!!\n\nI mourn for Fisher's. The Grande Dame is dead, and in her place is a gum chewing, belly shirt wearing Jersey girl. Yes, I love Jersey Girls as much as anyone for their candor and love of life, (they're the reason cars have backseats dammit!) but to see such a fine institution reduced to effective culinary rubble just hurts.\n\nGoodbye Fishers! I'm holding off on a final recommendation until my Aunt's 100th birthday in hopes that by then you'll either have returned to grace or shut down. Maybe you'll be a Friday's by then, or perhaps a huge Quizno's, who knows; and sadly, who cares? You've become the once divorced mom, hair dyed too red, drinking and smoking too much, while hitting on anything that looks like it might buy you your next drink. You're best ignored and left to survive in our memories as what you once were. I'll see you in ten years. Perhaps I'll wear my high school varsity jacket to blend in.",2009-04-15,15:06:04

Most of the rooms I stay in stare at the next building over. Rooms are relatively spacious compared to some of the boutique hotels in town, but wear a pair of white socks around the room and you get a concept of how 'clean' the place actually is.

A cross between a pharmacy and a flea market, make sure to double check expiration dates on everything you buy. Nothing like walking out with a snack that expired last week! Yummers! \n\nStanding alone at the end of the dying three shop strip mall, the only reason this place stays around is because it's close to the Wawa.

The bartender was polite and had a haircut from this century, and the clientele at the bar, although mainly 55+, were pleasant and chatty. \n\nThe wedding areas and banquet halls were as advertised garish, but heck, if you can't gaudy it up for a wedding when can you? The staff has definitely been cut back, with the older woman behind the reception desk in charge of room setups for the wedding. A sad tale indeed there.\n\nAs for the food. The rehearsal dinner brought a tired and wilted salad, house italian and thousand island reminiscent of the stuff they served in high school. Too few pitchers of water on the tables left the majority of the group (including the bride) parched. Stuffed capon was nice, but industrial in its taste and texture, and the rice stuffing as bland as the accompanying vegetables. I left both on my plate.\n\nWhy the two star bump? First, the TVs had been removed from the dining area, a huge improvement. Second, the food at the reception. Hor D'Oerves were delicious. Plump scallops wrapped in bacon were a wonderful change from the dried up knots of scallop jerky most places serve. Vegetarian offerings, such as red pepper, fresh mozzarella, and portobello skewers were a yummy treat, and the speed in which they disappeared showed the crowd was enjoying them as much as I was. \n\nI was encouraged enough to consider going back one night for a regular dinner there sometime soon, and perhaps you should try it again too.

I had heard good things from some of the reviewers I follow, so this was the perfect opportunity to try it. A quiet lunch on Christmas eve sounded perfect.\n\nAesthetics were great, with the flash style food paintings and big front windows highlighting the large space. I can see that noise could be a problem, but it wasn't for our lunch. We were seated at a two top which had plenty of room, unlike some of the micro tables in other places. There was no salt, pepper or (yikes) ketchup on the table so I was encouraged that the Chef knew how to season the food and was sending you a clear signal.\n\nA quick trip to the bathroom revealed three unisex bathrooms, all clean and well stocked. The one I used had no table to put anything down, leaving you the option of the floor for your purse/food container/whatever, or holding it while you went about your task.\n\nThe waiter was with us promptly, and our drinks were brought out right away. The menu had a nice selection of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches, but oh did my palate's heart jump when I saw Shrimp and Grits.\n\nFor those of you who read my reviews, you know that this is one of Marco's all time favorite dishes. There could have been fried terrier on the menu and I wouldn't have seen it after seeing this. (**See Below)\n\nI felt that Christmas spirit was over me as I ordered it, it was like telling Santa what I wanted.\n\nThe dishes arrived promptly, and as you can see in the pictures I posted were lovely to look at. My guest ordered the fish tacos, and there it was, my Shrimp and Grits.\n\nAdorned with a pinch of salad and some broccoli, it was surprisingly electric orange. That's cool. It was like a big bow and special shiny mylar paper on my present. I smiled as I brought the first taste to my lips.\n\nSocks. The present was socks. No - the food didn't taste like socks, but it surely wasn't the traditional shrimp and grits I was expecting, while salty, it was frankly devoid of any notes of fresh corn and not a hint of Worcester sauce. The electric orange sauce was the bringer of salt, being a salty cheese sauce. I guess it could have been worse and been bob's hot wing sauce or some Tabasco abomination.\n\nOverall, it was a good dish. I hate when they leave tails on shrimp but understand the aesthetics. Not having a bread plate I couldn't scoop them out and cut the tail off, so I was forced to pick them up with my fingers to de-tail them manually, the waiter was pleasant enough to bring a few extra napkins to help out with this process.\n\nThe shrimp were tasty and well cooked. The grits were good, and if anything a touch salty, but that may have been from the cheese and shouldn't be a discouragement to you. The 'salad' and broccoli were pleasant. As a whole, this was a nice dish, but no, I wouldn't order it again.  I also wouldn't discourage you from trying it.\n\nMy guests fish tacos were served with a large dollop of guacamole that was oddly colored. Tasting proved it wasn't a freshness issue, but a component issue that had them looking a shade off. The final verdict on these was that there was too much guacamole, which was a touch bitter, and ultimately defeated the taste of the tuna. \n\nSo, two dishes, both OK but not stellar. Good, prompt service, an eclectic menu, clean bathrooms, reasonable prices. I'll definitely be back.\n\n\n(**Author's note: I do not like fried terrier. I do not condone the preparation of terrier in any fashion, fried or otherwise, etc. It's a joke.)",2010-12-24,20:39:58

The restaurant is truly beautiful, with combinations of tables, booths, and banquettes composing the front half which allow for perfect seating for any sized group. The rear of the restaurant is the habachi area. Under the giant budda is a koi pond that was pristine. \n\nFor an appetizer I had the seaweed salad, and my partner had the Shooting stars. The three of us also split the Sushi Pizza. The seaweed salad was good but unremarkable. Same for the miso soup that accompanied my meal. The shooting stars, (hand made dumplings) were delicious and worth the 15 minute wait. The sushi pizza was a bit intriguing. Sushi served on scallion pancake with lobster salad (mine had no lobster salad) avocado, tuna and salmon. For $16 you would think someone would double check all the ingredients were on the thing. It was tasty, but the scallion pancake was tough. We couldn't decide if it was overcooked or supposed to be this way. For the benefit of out first visit, we're going with supposed to be this way and needed to be tough to support the toppings.\n\nI ordered three hand rolls that were well made and nicely filled with fish from top to bottom. I also had the sashimi deluxe, which was excellent. Extra points for the slightly chilled plates that kept the fish at the perfect temperature throughout my meal. the fish itself was perfectly cut and was exceptionally fresh.\n\nAs you can see in the pictures, my son's Seafood Udon was an exceptional size. He loved it and was able to eat about half.\n\nOk - so why three and a half stars? A few reasons. One, the forgotten lobster on the sashimi pizza. If you are going to charge me $16, make sure its all there. The staff is pleasant and attentive, but many times during the meal my waitress was brushing against me refilling water glasses and reaching in front of us to gather things while we were still eating. I'm all for quick service but this was almost the bum's rush. The next was when we were seated. the whole restaurant is empty short of one person and we are literally sat directly next to them. I selected the table two up so both we and the other table had some room to talk without being in each others conversations. I hate when places do that.  Finally, trying to find the bathroom at night is a bit of a challenge without night vision goggles. Although very cool and sexy looking, the very, very low purple lighting is going to make for some interesting nights when the older folks come in for sure.\n\nOverall, we liked this place better than Mikado, but not as much as Fugi.

My friend orders an ""OK"" pair of Chicken burritos that are no better than Qdoba.  \n\nSo here's the kicker...  About 3/4 through the entrees, frantic server appears again with a six-pack of sauce.  He gives me a bottle of HOT and a bottle of SWEET.  I pour out a bit of the sweet onto my plate (disregarding the crust around the rim of the squeez bottle) and dip my meat in.  UGH!!!

While I thought the overall flavor combination was nothing special, the frozen custard had a pretty good flavor.  Still, its lack of thickness kind of kept it from being really good frozen custard for me.\n\nThe other problem was that they did not really fill the frozen custard all the way to the top so it kind of felt like a less than generous portion.\n\nI also had their vanilla frozen custard in a cone.  While the frozen custard was too soft here as well, I think this option is a simpler and maybe even more enjoyable way to have their frozen custard.\n\nService was pleasant and quick and prices were reasonable for a frozen treat.\n\nI left Ted Drewes Frozen Custard disappointed.  For a very acclaimed frozen dessert spot, I was expecting a better experience than a Foster's Freeze in California, but I actually have enjoyed my visits to some Foster's Freeze locations more than my one trip to Ted Drewes.  Ted Drewes is still very prominent though and if you like ice cream, frozen yogurt, soft serve, gelato, or frozen custard, you should probably give Ted Drewes a try if you are in St. Louis.\n\nTed Drewes Frozen Custard has its own parking lot, which is free.",2013-03-01,02:34:45

From your seat in PNC Park, you get a great view of the city skyline as well as one of Pittsburgh's many bridges (such an iconic and easily recognizable element of the city).  PNC Park also flashes a lot of Pittsburgh's signature yellow color throughout the stadium.\n\nPhiladelphia's Citizens Bank Park, on the other hand, lacks city integration.  It is several miles away from the city so you do not get to see much of Philadelphia's great skyline from your seat.  In terms of the inside of the stadium, it feels big and not as intimate as Wrigley Field, Oriole Park at Camden Yards or AT&T Park.\n\nThe stadium design is okay to good.  While there is not a really interesting design or one that ties everything together well, there are a few good decorative touches like the huge Liberty Bell as well as the brick concession stands in the outfield.  The outside of the stadium has a nice look and there are great statues of star players like Mike Schmidt.\n\nThe crowd is very lively and can also be quite rowdy and ready to have fun, which makes for a fun atmosphere when watching the game.  The stadium can get quite cold in April and there seems to be a lot of wind inside the stadium, which results in many attendees running towards the concourse to try and stay warm.\n\nFood at Citizens Bank Park is good--better than most ballparks.  They have many vendors including a lot of local vendors.  I had a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's and while I am sure it would not compete with the cheesesteaks at a standalone Tony Luke's location, it was perfectly fine for ballpark food.\n\nI had Tony Luke's cheesesteak with Wiz and onions.  I thought the cheesesteak had a good flavor with the savory meat and the melted Wiz and sauteed onions.  I did feel the Wiz and onions could have been better distributed and I was not a fan of the bread.  The bread was like a very thick and dense French roll so it really overwhelmed the meat.  I enjoyed Jim's crusty and lighter roll much more.\n\nI also had some of Chickie's & Pete's crabfries, which were very crispy and hot (you do not often get that with fries at ballparks).  The crabfries were crinkle cut (but thin) and they were seasoned very aggressively.  I thought the crabfries were too salty, but maybe their cheese dip would have mellowed the aggressive seasoning.\n\nI also liked how both concession stands were run, which seemed to be more efficient than other baseball stadiums.  At Tony Luke's, you order your food at the register and a different group prepares your sandwich.  At Chickie's & Pete's, you grab fries from the high school cafeteria-like counter (where workers are constantly adding new buckets of hot fries) and then pay at a separate register.\n\nThe team shop was okay.  There was a decent variety though not as much as what you would find at the team shops in Cincinnati or especially St. Louis.  Still, there is definitely enough variety to find something that suits your personal tastes.  There are also several items featuring Philadelphia's iconic mascot the Phillie Phanatic.\n\nThe concourse is comfortable enough to walk through.  Given how big the stadium felt, I think I would have expected more seating.\n\nCustomer service was good throughout the stadium.\n\nOverall, Citizens Bank Park is a good stadium.  I think though it is also a notch below some of the newer stadiums like PNC Park, Busch Stadium, AT&T Park, and Petco Park.  Still, it is fun place to watch a game as well as to enjoy some hot and freshly made ballpark food.\n\nCitizens Bank Park is located in a sports complex that holds the other professional stadiums in Philadelphia (Eagles, 76ers, Flyers).  Because of that, the stadium parking lot is huge and it feels easy finding a spot.  I wonder how crazy it would be though when two sporting events are going on at the same time.",2013-07-02,03:30:50

Don't play it fast and loose, don't tempt fate, I assure you that YOU CANNOT GET THIS BURRITO AFTER 10:30 AM. \n\nYou definitely can't get it at 10:35 AM, even if you're starving for sustenance because you got lost and had to Bear-Grylls it down Starr Pass, show up panting and red-faced, and all but beg for the burro.

As someone who exalts Nico's as bacon-egg-cheese and potato as the paradigmatic breakfast-bundle, I obviously have more traditional tastes. Here's my take:\n\nI ordered St. Mary's burrito with carne seca, eggs, potato, and cheese. You can hardly discern the presence of the egg, it's so thoroughly incorporated into the carne seca. You won't find slightly steaming, toothsome, eggy pillows hanging out on their own here. Here, the eggy morsels, no larger than the head of a pin, resurrect the dried beef, giving it a moisture and depth of flavor that is lacking in carne seca alone. The potatoes are perfectly cooked and uniformly diced, and in proportion to the carne seca/egg combo, such that each bite yields just the right amount of both. The cheese, your standard yellow, makes a pleasantly oily, oozing introduction halfway through the burrito, taking it to the next level of richness at exactly the right time. Everything is working, nothing is going wrong. \n\nSo, why not a full five stars? Have I gone against everything Public Enemy taught me and fallen victim to the hype? Were my expectations unrealistically high? Perhaps, but I think it's more likely that this burrito showed me what St. Mary's carne seca could be with more moisture and seasoning. Also, because there wasn't enough egg to render this my perfect breakfast burrito.

The bikes are first come first serve and they told us they do run out sometimes on busy days, so get there early if getting bikes is important to you.  Free wifi worked well, and I thought the location was pretty good.  It's walking distance to both the beach and State St., although the particular restaurants we wanted to go to were further up State St., close to 2 miles from the hotel. \n\nWe did not have any of the perks others mention such as bathrobes, double-head showers, or welcome baskets.  Maybe that's because we weren't in one of the ""premium"" rooms, but I certainly felt like we were paying a premium enough price.  The water pressure in our shower was really terrible and the water ran hot-and-cold but other than that we were satisfied with our room.\n\nOverall, we had a nice stay but I feel like this place is really expensive for what it is.  Hotel prices in Santa Barbara are high and we did visit on a holiday weekend, but next time I'd probably opt for a cheaper hotel in a less desirable location, since I feel like the location is what you're really paying for here.",2013-06-02,03:55:21

But who do you go to fancy places with? Normally people you are trying to impress or at least not make them think that you are a crazy person. So Fulton Alley is tough for this girl. I had a great time at our Yelp Bowling tournament but that maybe one of the few times I will be bowling at Fulton Alley.

The food at Superior is pretty decent for a chain Tex-Mex place (says the girl from Virginia).

My biggest complaint was with my poboy. I had high expectations because I ordered the Shrimp Caminda and it was one of the winners of the Poboy Festival. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and tossed in a citrus butter. They were very flavorful and tasty. The rest of the sandwich fell short. The bread was kind of stale, the Asian slaw was piled on and protruding through the sandwich and the crazy cilantro on top was a handful of too much. I somewhat enjoyed my meal of fries and shrimp, but the rest of the sandwich got pitched. The table seemed to enjoy their salads and burger.  The burger on the brioche bun looked especially good.

I haven't been to Mr. B's since my first meal as a NOLA citizen over 4 years ago. This time, however, my mom and I made a mistake as we chose to sit in the dining room. Big mistake. Huge.  We were greeted (as in not even said hello to but somewhat acknowledged) by our hostesses, the twins from The Shining. One of them grunted and walked towards a table. I said 'Thank you' and she grunted back. Then the man of the hour, Giorgio (or as I will now call him George), came to take our drink orders. I ordered an old-fashioned and my mom stuck with water as she had had her one for the day. George was a slick waiter but friendly enough. He delivered my drink and came to take our order. We had decided on a bowl of Gumbo Ya-Ya each and to split an order of BBQ shrimp. As I spoke I heard the needle scratch the record to a halt. 'You realize that's only 3 shrimp per person, right?' George said in disgust. 'Yes, and that's fine, thank you' I replied. Well it was all downhill from there, folks. We were rushed through our entire meal, George asking to clear plates when it was obvious that we weren't finished , never checking on my cocktail status, asking about our gumbo as he turned his back and walked away. The guy was a jerk. The only redeeming service we had was from Terrance, who mostly served as a food runner but was extremely pleasant the entire meal. We ended up leaving 15% to George only because we knew he'd just stiff Terrance if we gave him the 5% he deserved. Our lunch bill still came to $50 and we were both so unhappy. Both Cindy Brennan and the General Manager were in-house at the time and looked like they could give a shit about their customers' experience. Now, to be fair, the food was delicious as always but with such an awful service experience we left full but with a bad taste in our mouth. It made us leave the Quarter and go back to my house for the day. This will never happen again. I will make BBQ shrimp for my visiting loved ones and never subject them to this kind of service again.

They claim to be a true ""soul food"" restaurant and although reviews varied, it seemed to be a place that I should check out. So, one night before hitting some music spots on Frenchmen St, we decided to stop by and try the Praline Connection. There must have been 12 servers and only two full tables in the place. Granted, we were pretty early for dinner so the lack of customers did not deter us. I opted for the crawfish ettouffe and a side of mac and cheese. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The staff had great personality and flair. Unfortunately, the food did not. My ettouffe was made with crawfish tails that smelled like they were about to turn (if they didn't already). The entire meal smelled like rotten fish. I ate two bites and I had to stop. I ate all of the mac and cheese which was lacking any good flavor, but at least it didn't smell like it had been sitting on the floor of a crabbing boat for two weeks in 100 degree weather. I don't remember what my friend had for dinner, but I can't say she raved about hers either. I hear that their fried chicken livers are what to have but since I don't eat those, I don't think I will be stopping back in anytime soon. Their pralines were OK, but I like Southern Candymakers better. \nBottom line: If you like fried chicken livers and being served by men in fedoras, check out Praline Connection.

It's too bad, because some of the food was actually good.\n\nFirst, we had to snake back and forth in a queue-holding labyrinth of ropes to get a wristband. Why? Nobody was ever able to explain it. If you paid for admission to the museum, you got a sticker. So what was the point of having a wristband for attendees who chose NOT to buy admission? Better to just allow us to go straight into the food truck rally without setting us up for future hair-pulling when it came time to remove the damn thing. Infuriating bureaucracy is not the first impression your event ought to make.\n\nSecond, the rally was on fairly uneven ground -- patches of sand, patches of grass, some level, some (near a playground) almost comically dippy. It was damn near impossible to get anywhere with a wheelchair except by going backwards and hoping we didn't run anyone over. If you try to roll over this awful terrain facing forward, your front casters will literally plow into the soil. There are commercially available surfaces you can install to make wheelchair users happy without reducing the permeability of the ground, and a science museum ought to be leading the way on stuff like this. (And a very special ""screw you too"" to the vendor who brought a two-level stainless steel staircase to help able-bodied customers, but didn't bring a ramp.)\n\nThird, someone seems to have gotten the terms ""food truck rally"" and ""monster truck rally"" mixed up, given the noise level from the engines and the unnecessarily loud sound system in the concrete echo chamber that held the very few available tables.\n\nFourth, even though most trucks routinely sell reasonably priced drinks, they were absolutely prohibited from doing so, because MOSI wanted a monopoly. And boy, did they ever exploit it (and us). The last time I paid $2 for a 12-ounce bottle of water, I was on a cruise ship. Yeah, it's that bad. I tried to buy a 16-oz bottle of Aquafina from the mixed drinks table, but the guy behind the bar said ""Soft drinks are over there"" and then turned his back on me to make sure I got the point that I wasn't welcome.\n\nFinally, some vendors just couldn't keep up with even the number of people who attended despite all these issues. One kept me waiting for 15 minutes for two baskets of cheesesteak fries, and started issuing warnings to new customers walking up that the wait would be 20 minutes. Jeez, guy, if you had warned ME it was going to take 15 minutes, I would have gone elsewhere.\n\nThere were a few vendors I'd love to patronize again in a parking lot, where wheelchairs roll smoothly and no monopoly prevents reasonably priced drinks, but I wouldn't come back to a MOSI food truck rally under these circumstances even if the food were free.",2013-10-07,13:15:42

When I saw a Thai place steps from my apartment I couldn't wait to try it. And when I saw the yelp reviews I was ecstatic.  \n\nI judge a Thai place on pad Thai, yeah that's right! its a staple dish that clues you in on the rest of the dishes.  I used to order in once a week while living in Boston because they have great ethnic food options (*sigh*)...\n\nI noticed comments about vegan/veggie options. Although this is true, most places will accommodate if you ask (again, at least in Boston they have).  I ordered tofu/veggie pad Thai, spicy. To-Go.  The veggies were obviously not fresh/overcooked.  The tiny pieces of tofu were overcooked and chewy.  The noodles were more on the dry side (which is fine) but the sauce lacked depth and was overpowered by the red sauce they used to make it spicy (sriracha??).\n\nThe Tom Yum soup smelt like sweaty gym socks and was out right disgusting. I couldn't even eat it. No idea what made it that way but it could have been the shrimp because when I ate the shrimp it tasted off.\n\nThe lady on the phone and at the restaurant was nice but the prices are higher than other Thai places I've seen around.\n\nI'd probably try something else on the menu, just to give it another shot, but I'd bet its not going to be much better.\n\nI'd suggest you go somewhere else.",2012-05-08,17:22:35

There was no sign in sheet. No one greeted us. After a while, we asked the people next to us and they had no idea either.  Waitresses moving in and around the crowd.  Several people waiting gave up and left. We asked the waitress how it works. Do we sign in somewhere? She said no, that the, presumed manager, ""just knows"" who's next based on when you came in.

Creamy Grits, Chopped Ham, Cheddar Cheese, Red Peppers, Mushrooms, Diced Bacon, topped with two Eggs Over Easy and Hollandaise, served with a Biscuit.  The bowl was perfect.  Ingredients equally distributed, fair amount of cheese. Not overly seasoned. Hollandaise on the side to eat as you wish.  The french toast was good as well, but I was very disappointed to see a single peach on my french toast. The menu says ""Peach Compote"" and fresh strawberries. There was a side of mixed fruit with a slice or two of strawberry.  (See photo). Peach compote would have been a very nice touch that may have put the dish over the top.  In the end, it wasn't any better than any Brioche French Toast I've had.  I slathered on some orange marmalade and it was better. \n\nMenu prices are on the higher end and here's where they get you.

The shepherd pie was ho-hum, much like all others, except that there was one huge briney olive in the lamb stew mix (which I wasn't sure was intended or not) and the fish and chips was nice, flakey but both nothing to write home about.  \n\nI find it promising that B&B is trying to find and create its own niche and with live music upstairs that might prove to be key - If the menu was revised to be smaller, more cohesive and more appealing I could be tempted to return and because I want businesses to succeed in my neighborhood, I will return - I just hope the whole place revisits its approach, menu and concept cocktails.  The place deserves it.",2014-04-08,14:49:04

Recently, I've been hankering for meat (ha, this winter weather!!), so I finally got my butt into a chair (a couple times now) to partake in this Village Whiskey burger that peeps have been talking up for what seems like forever. (those duck fat french fries too)\n\nSo my hopes were set high. So I partook, and sadly, I wasn't entirely blown away. A $13 Village burger, that quickly turned into a $22 burger (after I add caramelized onions, cheese, mushrooms) was cooked thankfully to temp ( a perfect medium) - and it left me wanting more. The patty was not revolutionary for me. It lacked unami and the fattiness that I associate with a truly superior patty - and to be honest, it struck me as just a regular standard ole' burger that you can just get at any joint about town.  And those duck fat fries!  Ugh, even a bigger letdown.  I'm not one to ever leave fries behind.  LEAVE NO FRIES behind, is usually my motto, but here I couldn't even work through them.  Entirely not cooked (fried) enough, overly chewy, bland, and severely under salted,  I did not enjoy them at all.  Such a bummer.\n\nBetter burgers are to be had at Butcher & Singer, ($10.95!) or even across the street, at Shake Shack at a fraction of the cost and with superior fries.

The owner was formerly an attorney and clearly is not a lifelong business owner, well-versed in customer service.  I can see where her attitude would turn potential customers off - the one thing that really turned me off was the way in which she admonished said bubbly clerk who I had encountered in the past when she couldn't locate a certain item I had asked if they had in stock.  Also, the owner audibly discussed other negative encounters with other customers on the phone as I was shopping around which I think is entirely inappropriate.

(well, heck it's always mentioned hand-in-hand with Standard tap, but that's another story for another time)\n\nYes, the place is darling, with its industrial city barn feel, replete with iron ceiling girders, wood plank floors and vintage/flea market decor. Yes, they have a menu to sate anyone's palate with offerings for the veggie and non-veggie eater alike. Yes, it's affordable and the portions generous. Yes, the freshly-squeezed OJ and yes, the food IS good.\n\nBut is Honey's the place of the second-coming of god-ly-eateries? NO.  Is this the brunch place to end all brunch places? NO.  If you're there over the weekend, there are so many other local restaurants in walking distance that have an equally good brunch, at a similar price point, minus the excruciating wait and the cooler-than-thou service - like Café Estelle, the Abbaye, N. 3rd, A Full Plate, Dos Segundos to name a few. \n\nI feel like Honey's is just as good as any of these places - but somehow along the way, it became the epitome of all things brunch and of Northern Liberties.  It became ""the"" place to go.  Which is fine, because we're all guilty of being trendy diners at one time or another.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, is this place (for grub, ambiance and the trend-factor) worth the hour + wait? NO and NO.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of this place, I just don't think it's worth my precious weekend time off nor do I think it's a required stop on the neighborhood tour.\n\nMaybe it's because I live a hop, skip and a jump from Honey's and if my hangover permits I try and go there before 9:30 am before the crowds roll in and often just grab a seat at the bar. I have that luxury, but I don't make it an every weekend habit.  \n\nIn any event, if you're in my neighborhood, it's still a nice place for you to get some good food but consider the alternatives.  If you're an impatient person like I am, go before 9:30 during the weekends and after 2 pm (but not on Sundays) - if you go with a group (more than 4) it will extend your wait no matter what.  If you're determined to go, bring the weekend paper, take into consideration inclement weather (there's barely any room to wait inside) and experience a tiny (but not exclusive) slice of Northern Liberties.",2009-09-14,22:20:51

I had been itching to try out another spa and when the salon/spa moved, I made my appointment for a true treat, a deluxe facial. (mama needed it!)\n\nI was expecting a bit more from this place, especially somewhere that's brand spanking new.  The interior lobby looks promising, sparse, modern, clean and I was greeted promptly with friendly ease.  I was showed around the Spa area of the place and it was decidedly smaller and more low-key than anticipated.  A few things made me pause. There as a coat check with a coat check person - which is the first time I have ever encountered that at a spa (for security purposes, who knows?) - and it felt formal and weird, but I handed over my wares (after all, it's winter, so I came bundled)  \n\nI was showed the bathrooms and the changing area and the waiting area, both places that I anticipated would be luxurious and have a bit of a wow factor.  Both were neither.  As far as changing areas go,  Toppers has the largest and more accommodating space with lots of privacy (dated though) - and Adolf Biecker's was surprisingly spare,  a small open space, two showers, a dozen lockers, and a bench.  No separate rooms in which to change, and no bells and whistles, and for crying out loud, even a low dropped ceiling!!  I was expecting at the very least, maybe a steam shower, some scented candles, mirrors, just more space to sit, and change.   The waiting area was another let down, super bare bones room, with a a couch, two chairs, barely no art, or relaxing atmosphere - and a table with one choice of flavored waters, and paper cups for tea and coffee?  Very budget.  My esthetician was on time and friendly (without being overbearing) - she wasn't overly chatty during the appointment and really let me relax.  \n\nThe treatment room was also very small and very clinical.  My facial was really nothing to write home about. I also had a hand and foot treatment that wasn't super special either.  For the deluxe facial, I anticipated lots of additional treatments and masques, but received none, no microdermabrasion, and nothing fancy.  My extractions were also possibly some of the most painful I have ever had. (let me preface this, by saying, I have a high pain threshold, and I've had extractions a plenty) - and even after the process, I felt like she had extracted only half of what really need to be extracted.  I was still in pain a couple days later from the process- which in all my years of getting facials, this has never happened.  I am not sure what happened here, whether my esthetician was inexperienced, or what, I just feel like I did not get what I thought I was going to get and what I paid for.\n\nLastly, there is no noise insulation in these treatment rooms and there was a lot of chatter and laughter in the halls that I could hear as clear as day, and which I could have done without. \n\nPlenty of places in this city where I've gotten better treatments for less.",2014-01-16,18:07:52

This place has been packed since its doors opened, and for good reason.  Seems like this area of town has been aching, begging for a place like Hip City Veg.  With its cute, modern interiors and with a menu that's sure to sate with all the comforting salad and sandwich options, all ""plant-based"" (aka vegan, why is that such a bad word anyhow?), what's not to love?  Yay. \n\nOptions have been hit or miss, which I'm hoping (praying, is more like it) is due to the fact that the place is simply overwhelmed by the demand and the pace, and they simply have not been able to keep up or properly anticipate the challenges of getting the food made well, quickly and out the door.  I loved their Buffalo Bella, but found the Fajita wrap dry and bland, their salads lacking enough ingredients considering their conservative sizes - but on the whole, what they offer is good (which is why I'm torn here, three or four stars? argh! only time will tell!), I just think they need to get their place in order.  Speaking of order, the must order here, I must say is their Groothie (apple, leafy greens, banana)-- so yummy, I would down a gallon of the stuff if I could.  \n\nSo, yeah, if you're planning on taking a quick work lunch, this place will have you waiting, so avoid the lunch rush (at this place, it's pretty much 11:30 until 2, I would say) if you want to try it out,  wait with the hungry lots and order with abandon.  \n\nAs for myself, I will be waiting a couple weeks until the crowds die down and until the Hip City Veg team gets into their groove.

The other day, though, some friends and I finally made it out for food and drinks.\n\nI don't know, fellow Yelpers.  This place is really just an average dinner spot.  The place is cavernous, so you can't really have an intimate feel there -- and probably not a unique experience, either.  I think we were all so-so about the food.  The pork steak was pretty good, and the pizzas seemed tasty, but nothing really jumped out at us.\n\nAnd the beer?  I think Schlafly beer and I have been going through a rough time in our relationship.  It's all just starting to taste the same.  I hate to blaspheme, though, so maybe I'll make that judgment, if it needs to be made, in a future and third review.\n\nAt any rate, I think Bottleworks would be a good place to take non-STL friends who are interested in a tour of the microbrewery and then lunch or dinner -- or if you happened to find yourself in Maplewood.

This place has a fun atmosphere and would be a big deal nestled next to campus in College Town, USA.  As it's located in Downtown, however, the feeling's a bit different.  It was reasonably hopping on a weekend night, and something tells me it gets nice and crowded when it needs to.\n\nDon't come out of your way for a burger, though.  Ours took forever to arrive, there was way too much bun in the package, and they were vaguely reminiscent of bowling alley burgers.  The fries upped the average, though.  Still, with a sub-$7.00 pricetag, though, if this place was downstairs, I might be singing a different tune...\n\nLots to do here: pool, whatever they call that scaled-down shuffleboard bar game, arcade games, a nice long bar.

I should have walked right away!\n\nSo the deal at the time was $99 to sign up and $59.99 a month thereafter.  I am an avid reader of contracts, and I pointed out the many loopholes to them before signing it.  I was assured it was a very casual contract, they were a neighborhood business, and they weren't going to screw anyone over.  What a convincing little song and dance.  Well, I believe in giving people (especially neighbors, and so called ""neighborhood businesses"") the benefit of the doubt, so I signed up because they were conveniently located and had yoga classes.  And for 6 months, I happily went to my yoga classes and paid my bills.  \n\n...Until one day I come in and find out it's going to cost an additional $10 a month (in the middle of my contract!!) to continue to attend those yoga classes.  Pretty shady, right?  Whatev.  Since they bailed on their own contract, all I want is a refund of the initiation fee, and a refund of the last 39 days I'd prepaid upon signing up back in December.  They've decided to ignore that request.  The excuses they've given me on the phone are piss-poor, and one member of their staff even got verbally abusive on the phone.  \n\nI highly recommend you check out the neighborhood message board, northernliberties.org, before considering a membership here.  I'm not the only one to complain (just the first one on Yelp, for some reason).  Here's one recent thread in particular: http://pub50.bravenet.com/forum/4226496069/show/637106\n\nIf City Fitness does the right thing and refunds my money (and reconsiders cheating its members in this manner) I would update my rating to 3 stars.  There are a lot of excellent things about this gym, and there are a lot of things that leave a foul taste in your mouth.  Here's the short list: \n\nThe good: \n- Many of the yoga teachers, including Lisa, Kelly and Mark, are fabulous and I miss them.  \n- The TVs & vents atop each aerobic machine are nice \n- The overall gym vibe is nice, full of neighbors, not meatheady\n\nThe bad: \n- The gym has some cleanliness issues.  Yes it is new so it looks new, but get close up to a yoga mat: they don't get scrubbed down and you can smell an interesting, unique sweat bouquet on each one.  Dust bunnies float about like tumbleweed, too.  The bathrooms are often out of toilet paper and I used a shower once and told myself never again, ew.  A professional cleaning company really needs to be hired here.  \n- When machines break, they should be fixed promptly.  Some of the treadmills were very shaky.  Some of the TVs and air vents don't work. \n- The nickel-and-diming across the board is very annoying.  How about providing towels for the prices we are paying?  Or the full shampoo/soap/conditioner range in the showers?  And the website still says a juice bar is ""coming soon.""  I was told it was ""coming soon"" in December and it's still not been worked on.  Oh, and the tanning bed costs extra?  They should clearly state what is covered in a membership before people sign up.  Because all things (that you don't know up front) considered, it's not that great a deal. \n\nSigh.

Granted, they give you a huge tub of it, but I'd be happy with a little solo cup that costs a dollar.\n\nThe chips and salsa is free and that's pretty much the only good thing I can say about my experience here.\n\nI most likely won't be back.",2015-01-03,17:47:51

Now, when you go to Chubbie's don't expect bells and whistles. It's just a small store with a few tables where you walk up to order and wait a few minutes for your food to be ready. Yes, it's an old Popeyes that has been converted into another chicken place.\n\nI went in for lunch and placed an order for a two piece white with potato salad, a drink and a biscuit. There wasn't much of a crowd, so there wasn't much of a wait. When my food came out, I was delighted at how crispy the chicken looked. There was seriously a thick layer of crust on the breast, the likes of which I rarely see. As I dug into the chicken, I noticed that it was perfectly cooked to tender perfection. The meat fell off of the bone and there was plenty of it.  The skin was light and crispy and practically melted in my mouth.  My only real complaint with the chicken was that there was no spice added to it. I like my fried chicken to have a bit of a kick (I am a Southern girl, after all) and this chicken had no kick at all. It was without a kick.\n\nAlso, the potato salad tasted store bought. I apologize right now if it wasn't. Maybe I am super picky when it comes to potato salad, because I've had the homemade stuff. While it was good, I think I will opt for the mashed potatoes next time.  \n\nAll in all, for a little over $6, my meal was good and I enjoyed it, I left Chubbie's satisfied and promising myself that I would eat healthy for the rest of the week. I wouldn't hesitate to return to Chubbie's with a bottle of hot sauce in tow.\n\nIf chicken isn't your thing, Chubbie's has daily hot plate specials as well as poboys, burgers, salads and other sandwiches.

This is my 2nd time staying here during Jazz Fest and this will absolutely be my last. \n\nI was extremely disappointed for several reasons this stay. \n\nFirst - the house keeping.  Words can't explain how lacking it was each day. They didn't replace soap or shampoo, they would leave the garbage, they wouldn't leave cream and sugar for the coffee even tho I left a note twice to please do so. I even asked for it when I saw one of the housekeepers and she said she would. \n\nBut the icing on the cake is when the sheets were soiled and I pulled all of them off to note they needed to be replaced.  We didn't arrive back until very late that night so exhausted I pull the cover back and they put the same dirty sheets back on.  In what world is this normal??  I stripped them for a purpose and it was obviously they needed replacing. I had to sleep on towels,  I was so upset with this. \n\nOur friends travelling with us on the same floor down the hall also mentioned their housekeeping was below subpar unfortunately. \n\nThe front desk was super unfriendly and the housekeeping just put the nail in the coffin for me. \n\nI will book elsewhere for Jazz Fest next time. \n\nPros:  I did request a room off Bourbon because last time was very loud late at night.  We were on the top floor in room 60 and it was very quiet back there. No elevator and no steps and no drunk people. \n\nLocation is very central. \n\nLounge is decent but I will review that separately.",2014-05-08,05:49:53

I mean I REALLLLLLY wanted to like Sunday's.  \n\nI had the opportunity to check in on a Saturday night and then I was also scheduled for a birthday brunch the next day. \n\nI have two seperate events I will describe. \n\nFirst, the Saturday night adventure. We had reservations for the evening and when we arrived, there were a few tables in there but the place was not busy yet. \n\nWe get service from a waiter who was already scattered and overwhelmed. Not sure why, as it was not very busy.  He takes our drink orders and we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them.   We can see them sitting there getting watered down for like 15 minutes.   I was tempted to grab them off the bar but I wanted to see what the issue was.  Well, I would have asked HIM but he never returned.  So a female server comes to the next table.   They are complaining they ordered their cocktails about 15 mins ago and asked her if she could check on them. \n\nI sorta piped in from my table and stated we were also waiting for ours. \n\nShe came back and delivered everyones drinks.  Still - our waiter is a miss. Yet I have seen take care of like 3 tables that have since come in after us and who are getting appetizers already. Us... well we haven't ordered. \n\nSo then about 40+ minutes, he comes to us as we are done with the small bread basket and says our meals will be right up and takes our menus.   WHOA - We are WAITING for YOU to take our order. \n\nSo table next to us is complaining and I was fed up but not rude. \n\nOwners lady/server comes over and is very nice and takes care of things. \n\nShe states that since they just won Best of The Bay in CL - they were not prepared to be so busy. \n\nI totally understand that but then you should have stopped with the 40 other people coming in if you couldn't handle the 25 already in there. \n\nFood - by the time we received it was ok. Not bad, but after waiting an hour, we were scarfing it down to catch our concert. \n\nI had a salad. Fresh but barely any dressing. \nI had the mussels and frittes app as a dinner with the salad. Would have been decent but was fed up at that point. \n\n-----  So then we left.  I was apprehensive about returning the next day but owners lady/server who was very nice made sure to let me know they would be FULLY staffed the following day and she guaranteed a better experience. \n\nSo Sunday come's....   We have a large table (about 12-14 people). I have a feeling that Dugg (review below) came in when we were there. There were actually two large parties that day. \n\nThe wait was crazy for people who came in even tho there were plenty of tables. They couldn't handle the amount of guests. \n\nFood for breakfast was subpar. Overcooked eggs, greasy bacon, super hard foccaccia as the base for the benedict.   Another bad day. \n\nSo I chalk a lot up to the place being very overwhelmed while they are experiencing growing pains.  They are not able to handle the customers that are coming in with one cook.   \n\nI would call this place Sunday's Dining and NOT Sunday's Fine Dining until they can work out the kinks.   There were a LOT of unhappy people on both experiences. \n\nFrom other reviews, I think the place has definite potential but I just think they need to get in a groove. I MAY (or may not) try them again in a few months but for right now, I would rather go elsewhere when I am in Ybor.",2011-09-30,23:00:56

I was greeted by the gentleman behind the counter in the catering area.  He was very nice. \n\nI head around the corner and find my friend who has a table. \n\nThe server comes over and we order two iced teas and an order of fried green tomatoes to start. \n\nThey come out pretty quickly and are very tasty.  This was the highlight of our meal. \n\nOur server is unfortunately very frazzled.  Jazmin was her name.  Very friendly but literally for an hour and a half all we had was apologies.  The place wasn't busy yet so I couldn't understand why she was so flustered the whole time.   We were friendly & courteous as we were really there to try it and catch up. \n\nShe told us a basket of corn bread would be out soon. \n\nWe each ordered the fried chicken - white pieces.  It consisted of a breast and thigh. \nMy sides:  Greens & Mashed Potatoes\nMy friends sides:  Mashed Potatoes and Lima Beans\n\nThe plates arrive after awhile.  No cornbread, we ask for it.  She says she will be right back. \n\nWe dive into the mashed potatoes at the same time.  One bite, that was it.  They weren't piping hot and they were very dry.  They def needed more butter or cream.  Neither of us went back to them. \n\nI then tried my greens which were decent.  Not soggy and still a little firm but a good flavor. \n\nWe then tried the chicken which looked amazing.   The batter had zero flavor.  No spices, no salt.  I have never in my life put salt on fried chicken but that is what we had to do.  It pained me do so. When my friend said Publix makes better fried chicken, that was actually true and saddened me. \n\nWe both picked at it a bit.  The cornbread the never came. \n\nOur glasses were never refilled.  When we asked... she would apologize and we would still wait another 15 minutes.  I really can't believe how she ran in 20 directions when she was only working a couple tables. \n\nWhen we were ready, we asked for the bill and it was brought to us in like 20 seconds.  We both put our credit cards down and another 20 minutes waiting to check out.  We had to call her back over to ring them up.  Another flustered apology. \n\nSo it seems she was having a bad day.  It happens. It didn't ruin our day. But the food and lack of service really need to change to bring me back in.  I would rather cross the bridge to South Tampa to Love's for fried chicken than have lackluster taste.  Please Sylvia - consider the reviews and vamp it up a bit.  \n\nI WANT to come back and I WANT to love it!  We shall see....",2014-01-21,21:11:46

We had a lot of people checking in on us and after reading some negative reviews, I wanted to start with that.  Hands down, very attentive. \n\nWe started with coffee and juice.  The coffee came out but the juicer was having issues so we received it after we were eating.  It was a bit sweet with the breakfast so I ended up waiting to drink it and take it to go.  I had the beet/orange/apple. \n\nFor breakfast I ordered the omelet with brie, avocado and crab on top.  Lots of great crab and a great amount of avocado but barely any brie inside.  Instead, the omelet tasted a tad dry and needed the brie. \n\nMy husband ordered the seafood special omelet with a cajun sauce.  The actual eggs/omelet was very overdone, dark.  The seafood he said was excellent and the sauce at least made it non dry.  Someone was having a bad egg day. \n\nBisquits - were delish. I ordered a side of sausage gravy and that was pretty tasty. \n\nOverall - very friendly staff, neat setting, quirky clientele.

It was our only go-to place when we visit Tarpon Springs. \n\nMy mom and I share a birthday and we thought it would be a nice day for the whole family to meet up, walk around the sponge docks and eat at Hellas. \n\nWe get a table for 8. A nice looking Greek waiter comes over takes our drink order. He had the personality of a cardboard box. We were in a great mood, happy to be there and obviously it was our bday because we brought in a couple gifts to exchange. \n\nHe seemed like he was visiting a funeral. \n\nWe order two large Greek salads and the cold spreads appetizer. The cold spreads included two types of hummus and a feta spread with hot pita wedges. \n\nPita bread was outstanding. In fact, the highlight of the meal unfortunately. \n\nSalads were as good as we remembered. Hummus wasn't the best but it was tasty. \n\nFor the table, our orders consisted of 4 Chicken Souvlakis, 2 Spanikopita meals, One Greek platter and a gyro platter. \n\nI was one of the unlucky chicken souvlakis. The chicken consisted of 4 bite size chunks of very over cooked and under flavored bites, half a raw onion and about a teaspoon of tzatziki sauce. We had to choke them down. The waiter never came to check on us and basically we had to flag someone else over for a mini container of extra sauce that we were charged for. Really sad. \n\nThe veggies on the side were inedible globs of overcooked stewed forms we didn't know what they were originally. Reallllly sad. \n\nThe platter which I convinced my brother to order because it used to be amazing was also so drab. It has gone downhill. The tastes all ran into each other and the grapeleaves did not taste fresh or homemade. They tasted like the ones my farmers maket sells in a jar. Ick\n\nWhen we finally managed to get our waiter for the bill, we told him how sad we were that the food has changed. He left and brought the manager or owner over. She apologized and said there was a new chef and would take care of the souvlakis on our plates that we barely ate. \n\nWhat that meant was bring us a piece of baklava? Anyways, I never look for a free meal but it really was a disappointing birthday meal for two of us. After stating she would take care of them..  well.. it was surprising. \n\nWe walked next door to the bakery and ordered cappuccinos and split a few desserts. Those were hit and miss as well but better than the meal. \n\nNext time I will try Mykonos which everyone on here says is the real deal.",2011-09-09,05:49:27

It's not often that we venture out to Society Hill so kudos to finding a reason to visit this part of town.  We got there for dinner around 9ish or so and sat down.  What struck me about the place was how much effort they put into their drinks, particularly their tequila selection (the waitress reminded me multiple times they were a tequila bar).  It's a shame that they don't put nearly as much effort into the food.  But when your bar area is about the same size as your dining room, go figure.\n\nWe started with an order of guacamole with housemade chips, the red snapper ceviche, and the queso fundo with chorizo.  First off, the guac is hideously expensive ($9 or upwards for a relatively small dish).  The design-your-own format is creative, but open to some pretty expensive and awful combinations (bleu cheese and crab?  really?)  The ceviche was messy and clunky to eat; the fish was still in really large chunks, so it was awkward when I tried to bring some over to my plate and didn't expect to be reaping such a large piece of fish.  The queso fundo was good, but kind of messy to eat as well.  Also, I didn't realize the chorizo was served ground; I would have preferred small cubed chunks or bigger pieces.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the steak tacos, which looked nice but like the other dishes, was poorly executed.  There was simply too much meat on the small corn tortillas, and I ended up dripping steak juice all over my hands while I tried to eat the tacos.  He got the deconstructed short rib tamale, which looked and tasted way better than my high-end tacos.  Served as a fork-and-knife dish, it was also less messy and awkward to eat and enjoy\n\nOverall, I thought the food was just ok.  Everything tasted pretty good, but there needs to be more thought put into how the dishes are going to be eaten, not just how they look or taste.  Not even my margarita, which was really damn delicious, could save this dinner or my chances of returning any time soon.

Yes, it's a custom blend of Pat LaFrieda meat with sauteed onions on a non-descript brioche-style bun, but that's all it was (with an oversized heaping of fries to boot).  For $18 (yup), it should have more on it than onions. It should also be cooked exactly how I like it (I asked for mine medium rare and it came out medium well.  No good).  My friend got a non-celebrity butchered burger that not only had more toppings, but came with a pickle and was perfectly juicy throughout (and cost her less coin).\n\nI'd definitely go back, but next time, I'll get my money's worth by ordering the $17 Fish and Chips platter which comes with three heaping golden brown pieces of battered cod, fries, and buttery mushy peas.",2011-01-26,15:08:05

This narrow, intimate bar/restaurant is usually crowded with young people and features a whiskey list as diverse as its patrons.  But don't let the name fool you: in addition to being Center City's premier whiskey bar, Village Whiskey also features a wide selection of local drafts, classic cocktails, and one of the city's most famous burgers, The Whiskey King.  Still, the limited dinner menu and small space make this place ideal for a night on the town rather than a night out to dinner.\n\nNo surprise that the food at Village Whiskey is very good, but unless you're set on ordering their signature burger (which will set you back a whopping $26), don't get your hopes up too much.  My burger was delicious, but not quite worth the time spent waiting in line to be seated and then for the food to arrive.  However, like nearby establishment 500 Degrees, the real star here is the fries.  Fried in duck fat and lightly salted, they taste as good as they sound and pair nicely with the Sly Fox cheddar sauce.  I only wish I got more fries than the rather small serving I shared that night.  Aside from burgers and fries, Village Whiskey also serves a limited number of other sandwiches, raw bar items, and other standard bar snacks.\n\nLike Garces' other restaurants, the scene and vibe is trendy with a hint of retro and a big push on sustainable and local dining.  Still, when the check came, I felt slighted, and I definitely felt that while the food was good, it didn't quite match the quality of other Garces restaurants and certainly not worth the price.  Overall, it's a good scene and a great Center City bar, but save your meal for Tinto and come here after for drinks.

I'm not sure if I would substitute salsa for the white sauce though. The falafels weren't dry and didn't feel too oily. I was in the mood for falafels and this place had high ratings so I gave it a try. I wouldn't recommend coming here just for that falafel sandwich though; I felt like this sandwich was overpriced. \n\nSide note: When I only order one dish, I consider it a snack.",2015-06-03,16:17:19

Finally see our waitress, talk specials and the mussel flavor of the week.  \n\nWe ordered the french onion dip to start.  I ordered the mussels in the sauce of the week (which was sun dried tomato).  \n\n20 mins later the french onion dip arrives.  Dip is good, bread to dip ratio is off.  ANOTHER 20 mins our entrees come out.  Mussels come out (I ordered the large order)... not a big amount for a large, and not in the chef's sauce of the week.  Waitress comes to check, offers to make another order of mussels, I decide no, not wanting to wait another 20 mins, and offers a free dessert instead.  Okay.  20 mins later, done for awhile, waitress no where to be seen.  The one busboy who has been fairly helpful (after being flagged down) brings us the dessert tray to look at and some coffee.  As our dessert is being set down, the manager puts the check on the table.  As we go to dig into the dessert, manager comes back and says, ""Oh, I forgot to put the dessert on your check""  WTF?!  Whatever.  At this point I say nothing.  It won't help the situation.\n\nSo, let me summarize.  Saw actual waitress twice.  Took at least 20 mins for appetizer.  Another 20 (after finishing app) for entree. Wrong entree.  Charged for free dessert.  And the icing on the cake... I tried to find the one bus boy who was helpful to tip him directly.

The mai tai was so sour that it tasted more like a margarita, definitely not what I was expecting. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, it's very warehouse-y with a bunch of decorations slapped around.

Eighteen and 1/2 hours later, we finally had our power restored. \n\nFrom 4AM to 10:30PM I watched as Peco trucks traveled down the road, along with firetrucks and police cars. The road was totally blocked, for most of the day. \n\nThis is what ultimately irked me... Asplundh arrived shortly after 4AM, with trucks for removing this huge tree and two flatbed trucks with new poles. \n\nThe Channel 6 news crews were there and the police stayed on the scene to direct traffic turn around. Peco workers were spotted having breakfast at the local eateries and or just sitting in their trucks in the nearby shopping centers. \n\nFrom what I have witnessed, this is atypical of Peco, Verizon and Comcast, to sit in their trucks and eat hero's and drink coffee. When will you be my hero guys? \n\nThe Channel 6 news trucks came, Peco flew down the road to the scene.

I'll give them larger, but if this is what you call meaty, the pickings are pretty slim, I actually burned calories trying to eat these things!\n\nOur server Linda, was a gem, she was friendly, helpful and knew how to guide us through the menu as this was our first visit. Five big shiny stars for her service! The food however was a different story... \n\nHubby started with a bowl of clam chowder, which was loaded with potatoes and tender clams, but nothing else, the consistency was good, however it really lacked in flavor, it needed so much more, perhaps onions, celery, I stirred in one pat of butter ( Paula Deen approved ) a little salt and pepper and that still did not do the trick, so I repeated this same procedure, but it really did not help.\n\nPhiladelphia is known for Snapper soup, but this tasted sour, the meat was tender and plentiful and a poor quality sherry was served on the side. We each took one bite and decided we would pass. The crab imperial stuffed mushroom caps were okay, but expensive, four small mushroom caps and I do mean small were filled with the imperial for ten dollars.\n\nMy two pounds of garlic crabs were all work and no play, but plenty of messing around trying to get out the minimal amount of meat, I was tempted to pick up those babies and start sucking the meat out of them! No more blue crabs for me, I'll stick with the dungeness, snow or Alaskan crabs from now on, better yet, saute me some pure lump crab meat in a little garlic and butter. I will give them this the garlic and red pepper sauce was outstanding, they should bottle it.\n\nHubby had the seafood imperial with crab, scallops and bay shrimp, which was a very rich but small portion and we both agreed it not only smelled very fishy, but tasted fishy as well, after two or three bites we decided to bring it home for the cat, but she was not thrilled enough to eat it either.\n\nThey have a full bar and a happy hour, my margarita was not very good, mostly bottled margarita mix. The hostess was not very friendly, well she was okay with us, but I had to giggle when two young girls moved from a table to a booth and she screamed at them "" you can not just seat yourselves!""

I had one bite, hubs thought it was okay and decided to finish it.\n\nA fresh fruit salad is served complimentary to each table which was a pleasant surprise. Michael ordered the eggs benedict which can also be ordered eggs Florentine. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the ham was nice and thick with a beautifully made hollandaise sauce. He had asked for them to add onions and peppers to his home fries and they were happy to oblige. He was thrilled with his order and raved over the home fries in particular. As a side he ordered bacon and their bacon is not wonderful, it was thin and very soft.\n\nI loved their hand cut fries and you get enough to feed an army! Three pieces of fish topped my huge plate of fries, the breading was way too thick and not cooked on the inside, even though the fish was cooked perfectly throughout. I ate half of one piece and decided to concentrate on the fries, bringing the fish home to reheat in the oven until the breading was cooked.

The walls on the outside of the restaurant are floor to ceiling open glass shelves holding the most beautiful and colorful pieces ranging from vases to blown glass. The entrance to the curvy black lacquered  hostess stand is surrounded by a red lacquered archway. Beyond this on the far wall is a huge flaming faux fireplace with a stone wall facade. You would have to see it to believe how gorgeous it is.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAdvbU6jmM4 The walls have grey/silver beads hanging at different lengths to form swags, the ceiling lights look like huge carved blocks of ice with beautifully lit egg shaped lights hanging from each block. What is really cool is the ice block lights change colors, although the clear was on while we were there and it is the most beautiful. They were so realistic I kept waiting for them to start dripping.\n\nAlmost anywhere you sit in this restaurant you are going to have privacy, the booths are large, very comfortable, with high backs and more ice looking glass dividers line the top of the rows. The bar is small, but they want you to have a seat in the restaurant and dine, there are plenty of other bars inside the casino to sit and drink. \n\nSome of the casinos chandeliers cost one million a piece, the rectangular bar of lights that over hangi this bar was like a multitude of diamonds shimmering beyond the glass walls.  Five stars to whomever designed this restaurant. \n\nJoseph was our server and it was only his second day or so, but the very friendly staff all work as a team and they leave you wanting for nothing. They caught me taking notes ( damn ) and suddenly everyone was sliding by our table one by one to give us more information than we needed, well maybe not... More on this when I review the Parx Casino, because we need to talk about the food.\n\nAfter you order your drinks a basket of bread will arrive with crisp flatbread, a good baked white bread and a brown bread with raisins and nuts. Along side of this a ramekin of whipped butter and another of a basil pesto will accompany this and possibly because we were starving, but it was the highlight of the meal. I also like the fact they have a sea salt and cracked black peppercorn grinder on each table. \n\nOther than the flat thick white plates that arrived in various shapes throughout the meal, there was no wow factor with the food. Hubby started with the clams casino $9.and rated them as average, the clams were chopped which we both do prefer and tender enough with onions and peppers, just not much seasoning to them, I had one, they were bland and we both agreed we have had much better.\n\nI started with the lobster bisque which was okay. There were a few tiny bits of lobster in it and when I say tiny I do mean microscopic but I have had bisque before where they have removed all the meat and it was still wonderful, this was very thick and dark, not much essence of the sherry shining through and it almost tasted old, like they had made a batch for the week and kept reheating it nightly. $6.\n\nMy chop salad was of Napa cabbage, nuts, finely diced carrot, bleu cheese crumbles, cherry tomato halves and okra? thinly sliced, it claimed that it would be topped with bacon and I could not find any, it was tossed with a sherry dijon vinaigrette and it was okay. $7.\n\nHubby had a skimpy 12 ounce sirloin that was aged and hand cut, well it may have been those things, he said it was cooked to a perfect rare, but it was a bit tough and had little flavor, he said the steaks at Acme are just as good. $28. I had the 8 ounce center cut filet mignon which was better than Acme's, however it came no where close in comparison to the steaks I have had at other good steak houses. It was cooked perfectly and upon request I did receive a rather bland bearnaise sauce. $27.\n\nWe had three sides Ala carte, all carbs baby! A small baked potato, a rectangle of potatoes au gratin which tasted like the dehydrated ones you get out of a cardboard box and doctored them up but could still taste the cardboard and mac and cheese using a orecchiette pasta and some cheese? and bacon, each $5., save the money for your trip to a great steak house.\n\nFinally they have two chefs, one specializes in the pastries, we had the liquid chocolate cake with a blackberry sabayon, Not! It was not quite dry, but it was not moist, very small, no liquid whatsoever and if this is what you call a sabayon then I think you need a few more classes. \n\nThey are open seven nights for dinner and lunch on Saturdays only and they do have a Sunday brunch.\n\nI'm sorry but it was just okay. 2.5 stars.  $111. plus 20% tip.",2010-03-27,20:33:19

First of all they make an awesome lemon drop or dirty martini and they are huge and powerful, yes and only $7.00, but do plan on hitting the sack after you've had one of these babies. \n\nJ.B. Dawson's mailed us a $15.00 gift card for no good reason, to be used when you spent $25.00 or more in food, so hey, why not? I'm glad we did, even though we spent a good $80.00, we were really quite pleased. \n\nThe baked potato soup was awesome this time, creamy and loaded with crispy bacon and cheddar cheese and I had seen the lump crab cakes scattered all over the menu and after inquiring and Shannon telling us they were pretty well pure lump and backfin, I opted to do the four mini crab cakes appetizer. They had a bit more filler in than I like, but they were still loaded with crab meat, peppers and spices, very good indeed and the bonus was a dill sauce served on the side which really complimented them. These were not little balls either they were larger than I had anticipated. \n\nWe also ordered the cajun shrimp appetizer because I am an appetizer whore and it was enough to be a meal with eight large shrimp, cajun coated and grilled and served on top of two thick slices of grilled garlic bread with a side garlic butter dipping sauce, something you could make at home easily, but it was still very good and gave me a new idea for a quick fix. \n\nFor my entree, yes, I have to have it all, I ordered the jumbo lump crab linguine alfredo! Hello, loaded with lump crab meat and the portion was huge, the linguine was cooked to perfection and the sauce was delightful, it's been a long time since I've had alfredo and it was a nice change of pace. \n\nListen to what hubby had! Monday's only, all you can eat baby back ribs with a salad of your choice and unlimited house or premium sides, $24.95! He choose the caesar and they do have anchovy filet's and extra shaved parmesan cheese, he added red onion and I ate half of it, shhh, no sharing is allowed on the all you can eat deals and no take home bags, even though we did... \n\nWe had a very long and tiring weekend with a wedding and a birthday party and we were both hungry, yet exhausted, so he did not even finish one rack and I had scarfed two of those bones. The ribs were outstanding, seriously perfectly seasoned, the sauce was very tasty, the ribs were beyond tender and meaty! He could have had twelve or more different sides be he only asked for the cole slaw, which was fresh and a large portion, garlic mashed for me and their fries rock, delightful little shoestrings of potato fried to a golden brown. \n\nWe ended up taking most of the food home and have another good meal out of it, I would not hesitate after this last experience to pay J.B. Dawson's another visit, especially with all of the new restaurants opening up and so many others closing down and what constitutes a chain to the other reviewers? There are four J.B. Dawson's well scattered, it's not like they are a factory or something and the food and service is good and their martinis kick butt!.\n\nOh and hey gluten free friends, they have an extensive menu just for you, including pastas!",2010-10-12,10:48:15

There was not one sign of trash, folks that were strolling,  jogging, dog walking or just sitting outside at one of the many cafe's were all dressed nicely and were clean cut, in other words, not a bum was to be found. For some reason it kept taking me back to Boston and that made me very happy.\n\nThe Irish Times blends in perfectly with this neighborhood, on the outside, walking inside was a queer situation, unique for sure, where you enter is just a landing and you are unsure as to whether you should take the flight of stairs up to what seemed like a very small bar area with no tables or down to the second or third level, which had another bar on an in between level.\n\nThe second level had maybe six two tops and one large booth tucked in the back corner, the bottom level had four larger tables. Now mind you the space is all wide open from ceiling to the bottom floor which is over fifty feet under ground. We stood on the landing for just a moment or two and then the bartender, who was manning the upper level bar, assisted in seating us on the second level. \n\nThe bartender at the second bar was also the only server on, so it was a good thing they were not busy. She was quick to greet us, bring us our drinks and then to answer our questions, however she was not friendly, she did not smile once or have one ounce of enthusiasm and she makes the worst margarita I have ever had in my life. I know, I'm in an Irish Pub and I should be drinking ale or whiskey, but I just don't care for either.\n\nThe broccoli bites that we ordered appeared to be hand made, the portion was large and upon request we were served a cheddar sauce to dip them in, they were pretty good.   \n\nThe cream of potato soup was just that, with large chucks of potato, it was good, but with celery, onion, cheddar cheese and bacon, it would have been much better. I'm in an Irish Pub, so I had to have an authentic Irish dish, which is always a hard decision for me, but when I ordered the fish and chips, our server said that I made a good choice and she was right, well half way right.\n\nAt least four large beer battered cod were fried to a crispy and crunchy golden brown and this was a beautiful thing! Really, very delicious, but the ""chips"" were steak cut previously frozen fries, so pale, no crunch, no golden brown and were a total fail.  Another thing that bothers me, if you are going to be in the business of serving authentic fish and chips, why all the use of Heinz malt vinegar? I know, I of all people should not hate on Heinz, but they do not make a good malt.\n\nHubby ordered a cheeseburger, who knows why, but he enjoyed it and I was jealous of his shoestring fries, they had been previously frozen too and were not crisp and golden brown, but they were much better than the ones I had. The cole slaw that came with my fish was just cabbage, nothing else, but I did like their dressing. \n\nThe menu reads potato pancakes $5.00, which I think is very reasonable, what we got was one very large grated potato pancake that covered a dinner plate. I thought it was different to top it with a white cheese, banana and hot peppers, but I enjoyed it, it certainly lacked in onions and the egg was not well blended in and came out like fried egg on certain portions of it.  \n\nHere is our real problem with the Irish Times, the food took an eternity to come out and from what I could see, most of the patrons were drinking and not eating. The broccoli bites came first, probably a good twenty-twenty five minutes after we ordered them. The soup took another ten minutes, which is ridiculous for a soup that is on the menu, when we inquired, the server said, "" well it hasn't been that long"". Our entrees came out a few minutes later, but is still way too long for a burger and fried fish.\n\nIt was probably a total of forty five minutes from the time we ordered our food until we finally got everything and when we placed the order, we had asked her not to hold anything back as we had somewhere we had to be. After we finally got all  of our food, a couple comes in, orders and is promptly served onion soup au gratin and before they could even get a few bites in their pulled pork sandwiches arrived!\n\nI was not a happy camper and at that point Michael said pay the check, I'm going to the car. I left a lousy five dollars and for me to leave a lousy tip is unheard of, but when she came up with my coat, once we were in the car, I handed her another ten dollars.\n\nTheir prices are reasonable and I believe they are cash only, they do have an ATM inside. I would give the Irish Times another try, I did love their fish and would like to try another dish, for this time and our overall experience 2.5.",2011-05-03,13:14:02

One voucher was for $44.00 for one dozen specialty cannoli ( which cost me $22.00 ) and the other was for $24.00 for one dozen specialty cupcakes ( which cost me $12.00 ).\n\nBefore leaving home, I had called to ask what their hours were and she stated they were open seven days per week, from 7am to 7pm. So one would think that at 2pm they would have specialty cupcakes and or specialty cannoli, but they were totally sold out. If you know that you are going to be open for another five hours on a weekend day, have more baked and ready to sell.\n\nI had two choices given to me, I could either hold onto the vouchers, which expired in two weeks and come back or accept regular cupcakes and cannoli. I chose the latter since we live a good twenty miles NE of S. Philadelphia. \n\nFor my $24.00 voucher I got 12 of the driest cupcakes I have ever purchased in my life, no flavor, although the icing was a rich butter cream, the cake was so bone dry with no flavor, I would have been better off buying a box of Duncan Hines cake mix! A quart of milk would not even be enough to wash them down! My only two choices were chocolate or vanilla, not sure how their specialty cupcakes compare, but these babies were old, stale and needed to be tossed out.\n\nThe cannoli were fabulous, a perfectly crisp cannoli with the most delicious chocolate custard, vanilla custard and mascarpone cheese with chocolate chips, I got four of each. They were not at all skimpy on the fillings, it is no wonder they have won numerous first place awards for these!\n\nMy biggest problem was, I also bought two eclairs and a rather nice sized napoleon, which were each $3.00 and the gal said, if you buy $15.00 worth, we will give you a code for receiving $5.00 towards your next Eversave purchase! Dummy me, buys two more eclairs, now one would think that since I have already lost out on my other two deals, when I inquired as to the difference in price between a regular and a specialty, it was almost double the price. You would think that she would have either given me the first three free or gave me the voucher code free at will or at least the last two to total $15. They offered me nada! AND the voucher code will not take, as Eversave says it has already been redeemed, so they must have given it out twice?\n\nThe eclairs were okay, mine are a whole lot better, but if you are not into making them, they will suffice, the napoleon was not so good, piled high, lots of custard, but the phyllo dough was all caked together like a thick and very hard dry cookie, they needed to be brushed layer by layer with butter and the word flaky never came to mind.\n\nThey had some exhibits of various cakes sitting around on the window ledges, that needed a dusting and you could see the lovely finger prints the patrons made while checking to see if they were real. I would return for the regular cannoli's in a heartbeat and to hopefully try ONE specialty cannoli and ONE specialty cupcake.",2011-09-24,17:43:21

Sometimes I wish that hubby would open a Yelp account as he was thrilled with Las Cazuelas. \n\nMichael had a huge plate of three large enchiladas, substituting ground beef for the chicken and asking for the mole sauce to be on the side. The mole sauce was amazing, I'm not surprised that it has won awards and I dipped my everything in it! His meal came with a nice sized portion of black refried beans and ""Mexican rice"", nothing like a Spanish rice, very plain, no onions or peppers, yellow rice.\n\nI could not get past the list of appetizers, so I ordered three as my meal, oh shush...  Queso fundido, which means melted cheese, not, it was one big blob of cheese, nothing dippy or stringy about it, hardened within seconds and it would have taken a knife and fork to cut it and it was not blended with the extra additions of chorizo and mushrooms, but was swimming in a spicy and extremely greasy sauce and served with three tortillas, to do what with, ugh, I have no clue. I packed this up to take home and try to melt, which it refused to do and I kept thinking, imagine what that would do to my arteries, so I chucked it. I guess I could have pretended it was string cheese and sliced it and ate it cold in its hardened form.\n\nThe guacamole ranchero was good, nothing special, I've had much better guacamole and chips, but it was satisfying, although a very small portion. The shrimp ceviche was very enjoyable, again, a small portion for the price. I also had a side dish of refried beans, that I asked to be topped with lots of raw onion and cheese and I really did like this dish.\n\nI checked out their brunch menu which is very enticing and I would love to return with gung ho hubby to indulge in this.",2011-09-12,16:17:35

The creamed spinach was good, not grand, the Greenburg potato skins were pure fried potato skins, no potato at all and served with a sour cream and horseradish sauce. Do it at home and save the big bucks. \n\nMy big dilemma is we have more open table certificates that we would have loved to have used and we have no problem mentioning yelp, but they do, so I'm trying to even reason why I would want to return at this point Douglas?

It was once a place where you would feel like you were walking into the middle of the past century and beyond to find Don Draper and his mad men croonies, ah times change and everything else along with it, but this time it was a sin.\n \nWe were early for our reservations and were going to have a seat at the bar, but decided to check in with the host and he offered to seat us right away, seeing we were famished, we took him up on his generous offer, Food! Our server immediately greeted us and offered us drinks, hubby had a coke and I had an excellent dry martini, served in a rather large cocktail glass, well chilled and made to perfection.\n \nOn the Prime Rib page of reviews on Yelp, it says to mention Yelp and you and anyone else at your table will receive a complimentary appetizer and so I did, which he was not at all enthusiastic about and it clearly showed. Then I pulled a rabbit out of my hat or rather a printed certificate from an Open Table offer that they and the Prime Rib had made publicly, to pay $25.00 up front to receive $50.00 off your bill when all was said and done. \n \nThis really did not thrill him and he was very obvious about his distaste in our lack of class ( in his mind ) to take the Prime Rib up on their own offers. Not only this but several times our server and a group of other staff members were nearby our table, talking about us and looking right at us, like how could we?! Even over at the service area for the bar, they turned and stared at us, laughing and talking. I'm serious folks, it was down right rude, made me feel like a clown and was the beginning of the most absurd service I have ever experienced.\n \nWe sat at least 20-30 minutes waiting for menus, while hubby stewed watching others being serviced and finally received our Yelp appetizer which was one large ( Diver, I'm assuming ) scallop each, wrapped in practically raw bacon on a small bed of baby spinach leaves. The scallop was cooked perfectly, I gave hubby my bacon, but he and I both agreed it was too raw to eat and then we were handed menus, which was a good forty minutes after we had been seated.\n \nWe shared the most bland bowl of lobster bisque that was served in a cool tureen style crock, absolutely no hint of sherry and I used to love their bisque, our waiter brought us a hot pepper sherry sauce in a bottle, but we passed, as it was very hot and the sherry did not even attempt to shine through.\n \nThe large oyster Rockefeller were outstanding, the escargot were tender and swimming in a garlic sauce with baby mushroom caps and a thick slice of grilled bread to dip into the sauce. The jumbo lump crab cake was large and pure but very un-adventurous other than that and was served with a lousy cocktail sauce. I had to giggle silently as the table next to us commented on their choice of sauce to serve with a lump crab cake. I myself had asked for the mustard sauce that was previously mentioned in their crab claw appetizer and it worked to help.\n \nWhen our meals came our server finally grabbed my hubby's longtime empty coke glass and refilled it and asked if I would like anything else. I asked what chardonnay they had by the glass, he offered several, not mentioning the names but the regions and I chose a Sonoma, when he brought it he had the label totally covered and poured me a sip, I asked to see the label and I was thrilled to see that it was Sonoma Cutre, one of my favorites and then he was about to walk away when I said excuse me, can you please pour my glass of wine? Oops.\n \nHubby was served a huge roast of Prime rib and he was kind enough to cut the bones off first to save for my onion soup for Christmas, his meat was cooked to perfection, tender, flavorful and juicy, however my filet was a big let down and we had already spent so much time there and just wanted to leave. I had ordered it medium rare and when I cut into the first third of it, the first cut was medium well, no pink or red whatsoever, but the center of the steak was barely pink.\n \nI was not going to say anything, but for a dry, flavorless piece of meat at $38.00 and the thinnest, un-flavorful bearnaise sauce I have ever been served, I thought this is so wrong, class or not speak up. I did and he argued with me! He said well the outer edges will be well done, I had cut one third into my steak, come on buddy this is not the first place I have had a steak is what I wanted to say, but instead I showed him the center and said it is barely a hint of pink and even the top and bottom of that was well done!\n \nTo be continued in another update, this is how upsetting this dining experience was.",2010-12-28,16:20:17

The European influence is evident on this menu, and I feel like Chef Besh captured the essence of what a cuisine does as it mutates over the years. He just skipped the 50 years it would take for his menu to evolve by being chef-smart and pulling it together. \n\nOthers have complained about the beer and wine in odd glassware, but it somehow suits the restaurant. I feel like I should bring my grandfather here for lunch. Retired lawyers and doctors and high-powered business people would spend their morning here, reading papers and sipping a beer and chatting. Lüke feels like the Galatoire's for a different class of people. \n\nI've eaten at Lüke a couple ways: straight dinner, just apps, and a mixed meal. The very best decision I made was P&J oysters (a dozen for $13!), the poached yard-egg salad sans bacon (oddly filling), and a slice of Black Forest inspired cake (rich, creamy, heavy with Chantilly cream). The oysters here are always delish, and the price of the local oysters (P&J, for those not in the know) is really competitive for a restaurant in the CBD. \n\nIf Lüke is my magical fantasyland of a restaurant, why only three stars?\nLe sigh. \nSay it with me: the service.  \n\nThe first time my lady and I came, our server looked like she was on speed or something. She was spacy and wired and jumpy without ever making eye contact. Of course we had a chat with the manager. I honestly thought it was a fluke because there were three other servers working the back room (where we sat) that were amazingly attentive and charming. \n\nThen I jump on Yelp and see that everyone else hates the service. But...but...but I love Lüke! I don't want to hate Lüke! This is my little oasis in all of New Orleans! Am I deluded? \n\nSo I visit again. Similar experience. \n\nAnd the third visit is really what sealed my review. \nI came on a Sunday night after work. I sat at the bar with my Kindle. There were two bartenders, hopping around Doing Important Things™. Between making drinks, gossiping with waiters, avoiding the managers, and running back to the kitchen, I sat for 20 minutes before anyone greeted me. Then the really surly bartender threw my menu at me as she walked past. That was surprising. The rest of my meal unfolded in similar, odd fashion with long periods of being ignored followed by rushed service. Having to defend my plate of oysters kept me amused which was good because I probably would have lost it and snapped at someone after the 4th attempt to remove them before I was finished AS I WAS SLURPING. It was like a game, only I would always be the loser. The food runners who brought my salad and my dessert didn't speak to me when they set the food down, but I don't think I can fault them on that. I was obviously reading. It was clear that I was busy so I think they were trying to respect that. \n\nThat dinner took two hours; to say it borders on excessive for one person, seated at the bar, with no cooked food is an understatement. \n\nI think I'll keep coming to Lüke, but my expectations have shifted. (I'm getting so much better at managing my disappointment.) Lüke, if you ever shape up, I'll call you like that proverbial ex-boyfriend who promises to join the Army and get things together. \n\nAccessibility notes: Revolving door at entrance is not automatic.

There is something devilish afoot if that is the case, and yes, it is. \n\nWe thought it would be romantic to have dinner at the old church, what with our proposed careers as ministers. When the old church is half empty at peak hours on a Friday night, there is something devilish afoot. \n\nOpener to the meal: the ceiling is leaking on our table. No one notices but us, despite a growing stain on the tablecloth and the steady plink-plink-plink of water on a bread plate. I tried to convince my dining companion to just put his wine glass under the drip because it would have entertained me. He was having none of it, and I agreed that we probably shouldn't have to dine in a rom-com just because we could. When we asked to move, we were given the stink eye by a waiter. Something devilish was afoot. \n\nFirst act: service was slow, and we were often ignored. It took us 20 minutes to get water and place drink orders. In another 20 minutes...something devilish was afoot. \n\nSecond act: the menu looked delicious. Everything was tempting except the prices. I was a little taken aback at the numbers compared to some of the other big games in town. Something devilish was absolutely afoot. \n\nIntermission: this is the part in the meal where the food takes half a century to appear. Because that happened. Yes, friends, something devilish must have been afoot in the kitchen if it took that long to make our food. \n\nThird act: the appetizers were stellar. My choice of wine was stellar. I am clearly superior to my higher instincts. Things look very good from this vantage point. Nothing devilish was afoot. \n\nClimax: entrees appear after a pause of forever. Neither are quite hot enough. Both are too salty. Let me repeat that: both entrees are way, way too salty. At $26+ per plate, we should not have salt issues. (Lest you think I'm an anti-salt crusader, I don't think I've ever had a problem with salt in any of my other Yelp reviews. Me and NaCl are buddies. We go way back.) This is Not Good. Can we find a server to comment on this? Nope. We were both hungry so we plowed ahead on the eating portion, but I probably should have brought the salt thing to a staff member's attention. It just seemed like an extra pain in the butt at the time. Something was afoot, and it was devilish. \n\nFinal act: dessert was necessary to wash away that entree disaster. We shared something or other, completely not memorable. At this point, we were looking at our watches and wishing for a swift end to the evening. The kitchen drew the meal out for far too long, and the service didn't help things along. The game afoot was devilish, no mistaking it. \n\nCritical review: devilish and not in the ""eggs, which are delicious"" way.

Just neutral.\n\nThis location of Blaze seems to be a cheap, easy place for rising 20-somes to grab dinner in the CBD, just steps from their luxury apartment without admitting that they are eating what is basically fast food. The pounding generic rock drowns out the desperation of a disaffected youth growing older and more cracked as the seconds pass. It also drowns out any hope of polite conversation, pushing every exchange into the register of shouts and howls. I don't love it.\n\nThe other down-vote I have for this location is that everyone who works here seems miserable. There's no amount of commanding from on high that can make under-paid, over-worked, poorly-managed employees into a happy chorus of Disney-esque dancers that are ready to dazzle and delight just for their own pleasure.

Many times, it's delicious. Not as stellar as what I'd be making at home, but I'm paying someone else to do my dirty work today so why would I be making it at home! \n\nThe service can get weird. The ladywife and I have been there during the hospital rush, which is no fun. That's when servers are hopping to keep regulars happy while the bartenders are pouring drinks down the throats of flush young professionals who don't look like they've ever had a student loan payment to worry about. (Then again, they could be drinking because of all those student loan payments. It's a toss up.) If you aren't a regular or clad in the de rigueur scrubs, expect to be ignored during the late lunch hour that hospital folks seem to keep. \n\nAnd dinner starts early because those aforementioned young professionals crowd the bar to sip away their sorrows, too. Things are hopping until 7p, when most of the crowd has poured themselves into a some means of conveyance home, leaving the aftermath strewn around Superior. \n\nThe servers will look shell-shocked for the rest of the evening. For that reason, I've never managed to squeeze even a tiny bit of salient information out of anyone working here. If it isn't one rush, it's another. \n\nThus far, the kitchen has managed to avoid killing my wife, but I always get the feeling that's an accident. Like they just happened to avoid tossing a few shrimp on her plate because someone was absent-minded back there. If you have special orders or a majorly important dietary request, I wouldn't feel comfortable sending you to Superior. The only reason I don't dial 9-1 before our meals is because the hospital is spitting distance from the restaurant. Need to jog over to the ER and get an epi-pen? Not so hard! (This clearly conveys my confidence with the institution.) \n\nAnother thing I can't quite figure about Superior: It's always incredibly loud, no matter the time of day or how busy they are. I haven't sussed out how that works yet. \n\nThere is no one dish or special that is really stunning, and the food appears so fast that it's impossible to be cooked to order. But that's okay. The quality trumps Taco Bell...hey! Maybe that should be their new slogan! \n\nSuperior Grill: It's better than Taco Bell. \n\nNah. What about...Superior Grill: It's not as bad as Taco Bell! \n\nThat's a keeper, folks. \n\nAccessibility notes: Restaurant is hardly accessible for mobility devices.

But in this case, it's more than merited. \n\nWe strolled through the French Market in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, and it was fairly busy, but definitely not overcrowded. My wife and I wanted to try something authentically New Orleans, so we chose the N'awlins Cafe. They were serving all sorts of Cajun/Creole food, and had tons of pictures with celebrities eating there, so we felt good about the decision. \n\nBoy were we wrong.\n\nWe ordered our food, gumbo and a burger, after a few minutes of sitting down. I waited 5 minutes before having to go to the bathroom (it WAS Mardi Gras, right?). So I trekked the 5 or so blocks back, waited in line, yadda yadda yadda, and walked back. All of that taking about 20 minutes. No food had arrived. Right when I got back, two women sat next to us and ordered. As we waited longer and longer, food was flying out of the kitchen. After another 10-15 minutes, the people next to us who had ordered when I got back, received their food. Finally my wife said something, and after re-taking our order it seemed, the food came out of the kitchen after another 5 minutes. All in all about 30-40 minutes of waiting for already cooked gumbo and a burger. \n\nI can usually forgive things like that, had they said it was busy, that they'd forgotten the ticket, or whatever the case might be. \n\nBut what can't be forgiven is the taste of the food, which was the worst that I had in 4 days in New Orleans. The gumbo was a tiny portion for $7, watery, and with an inedible skinny crab claw on top. My wife's burger was a downright disgrace though. I can make a better burger with a frozen patty from Costco. It was miniature in size, and about as hard as a frisbee.

My guest and I stood at the entrance for a moment, but no one came to greet us. In fact, there was no service staff visible anywhere in the entire restaurant and bar area when we arrived. (We knew they were open because there were about 20 other people seated in the restaurant.)  We eventually picked a booth and sat ourselves.

The fillet was incredibly tender, but mostly flavorless.  My guest's sides were grilled vegetables and sweet potato mash.  The vegetables were again tasteless, but the sweet potatoes were incredibly sweet.  \n\nIn the hour and a half we spent at the restaurant, our server only refilled our water glasses once and was only at our table a total of five times!

Being in the middle of the afternoon, there wasn't a long line, and getting seating inside wasn't too hard either.

To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that I had seen on here (and other places on the Internet).

I do have a soft spot in my heart (and belly) for maple donuts, which explains why I liked that the best flavor-wise - but it also didn't have any hint of spiciness at all, which makes me wonder why the description even bothered. The chocolate glazed donut was very average to me, and the cookies and cream was also pretty generic...there was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top.\n\nOverall, the donuts are different from what you'd pick up at a Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts, but it didn't measure up to the uniqueness (and tastiness) of other donut-centric shops that I have been to.

Most of the time when we visit town, we stay near Center City or Rittenhouse Square, so this was a bit of a change of pace, being all the way at the eastern edge of Philly. The hotel itself is relatively spacious, as it takes up more ground space but only goes up 4 floors. As such, walking around to get to your room could take a bit of time, and that makes it more frustrating because a) you usually end up stopping at every floor on the way up (so being on the 4th floor, as we were, feels much longer), and the elevator is old and slow to begin with. Nonetheless, the view of the lobby feels much more open than Le Meridien (which has a similar setup) when the sunlight pours in.\n\nThe room itself was pretty standard and average. Given the hotel itself is pretty short, our narrow window afforded us a view straight into what looked like another apartment building. Walnut Street isn't all that wide to begin with, so you really don't have much of a view. The amenities were pretty standard (although I did appreciate the complimentary Dasani), but the water pressure in the shower was a bit on the low side, and the bathroom generally felt a bit older. And like most hotels that haven't been refurbished recently, the outlets were all a bit far from the bed, meaning that turning off the phone's alarm clock meant wandering over to the desk.\n\nEverything was generally okay, and while the hotel was a bit more expensive than the amenities provided, I do like that it's on a cobblestone road, slightly off of where all the typical fun in Old City occurs - making it a quieter place to stay while in town.

Getting seated wasn't too difficult, even though there was a decent crowd. With a big dining space, and a slightly elevated section across from the kitchen, there's a lot of room for folks to spread out and enjoy their own space. Service was serviceable, even though they didn't accommodate a request for us to move to another table (we were a bit jammed in between others). Not much to say beyond that, aside from the food that came out pretty quickly.\n\nThe food is primarily oriented towards Southeast Asian cuisine, but it doesn't particularly excel at it. I don't have much bad to say aside from the Hainan chicken, which was a quite limp and honestly just did not taste that good, with or without the skin, with or without rice. The whole fish was supposed to be simmered in ginger, but the fish itself did not retain as much of the flavor as I would have wanted...it definitely came off as weakly flavored of ginger. Nonetheless, it was still quite flaky, even if you did have to work your way around the bones. The seafood casserole...it was passable, but not much to say either way.\n\nWe did walk out relatively full and satisfied, but Penang didn't really swing the pendulum one way or the other for us. The service was as expected, and the food didn't really beat expectations either. There are a lot of choices here that would make it worthwhile to come visit again, but I would not come back expecting to have a substantially different experience.",2016-12-31,03:23:49

You seat yourself. \n\nThe place is a lounge which seemed to just be smack dab in the middle of a chicken joint, or is it the chicken joint was built around the bar? \nWHAT CAME FIRST THE CHICKEN OR THE BAR?? :-)\n\nThe decor in there was..... interesting..... \nThere is video poker at the bar if that tickles your fancy!\n\nMy main complaint is the floors were dirty, and needed swept - and should have been since the place was basically empty and well past rush time! To me that just screams LAZINESS on the part of the staff - though lazy they were friendly! \n\nOur waiter was the perfect balance of attentive but not annoying so I did like that! \n\nI was a little annoyed with their being 4 big screen TV's all on different channels --- but the 80's hair band music playing was kind of cool. \n\nThe menu is a big laminated sheet that stays at the table, which I like so I can keep reading it even after I've ordered. This place is a little pricey for what it is, and what you get, and considering chicken is so cheap. They seriously should rethink their prices!?!?!?!?!?!\n\nWe got.... \nA LARGE basket of garlic fries $6.00 - which was the best thing going, but not as much flavor as I would have thought. Very mild. \nChicken wings - I'm not sure how THOSE won any awards as they claim because they had very little sauce on them, and were BORING! Maybe some of the other flavors are better but those were just kind of LAME - 12 pc. for approx. $9.00 \nThe fried chicken -- 4 pc. for $9.00w/cole slaw, mashed potatos and a biscuit - the chicken was crispy as everyone raves about, but beneath the crisp was just FATTY chicken - not very good quality. The crispy crunchy batter didn't have a lot of seasoning, and it was pouring grease. So not my favorite. \nCole Slaw - it was just a tiny plastic cup (less the 1/4 c.) and not very flavorful though it was very fresh and crisp. KFC's cole slaw totally takes the prize!\nMashed potatoes - were very interesting. They were of the (runny) instant variety, and covered with a interesting CHEESE sauce NOT gravy - it tasted EXACTLY like those out of the box Betty Crocker ""scalloped potatoes"" not at all like mashed potatoes.... but since I like Betty Crocker I kind of liked these too!\nThe buttered roll was just a roll nothing special. \n$35.00 for two people to eat greasy chicken and boring wings. \n\nI might have to go back because they have a CHICKEN Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich - which to me sounds very good, but I dont think I'd ever order the wings, or fried chicken again.",2009-06-06,14:04:31

The meat is MUCH cheaper at WinCo! They have a much bigger and better variety as well. I was also really impressed with their deli and cheeses it all looked wonderful and prices lower then I've ever seen for some of the higher quality items! They also have a great fish/seafood section. \nAnother thing I like about this store is their breads - WAY cheaper then anywhere else and the loaf of bread I picked out is so soft it felt like a cloud!

And so when this store opened I walked up and down basically every aisle looking at prices and if they beat walmart it was only by a penny or two.

They have both booths and counter, we waited on a booth. \nIts a cute 50's style diner type place, serving mostly hamburgers, and hot dogs, fries, onion rings, malts and that type of food. I like the GIANT hot air balloons going through the roof, and they have the old juke boxes on each table and you can play an oldie for .05 cents but we didnt get to because a band right next to us started playing, I'll explain in a sec! \n\nOur server was nice enough, and came by several times to check on us but we felt VERY rushed. \nWe ordered our drinks and was going over the menu and she kept coming back to see if we were ready to order..... we werent but went ahead and ordered. We wanted to start with an appetizer - mini chili dogs (3) which came pretty quick, and were REALLY good. We were only 3 bites into our appetizer when our order came - which is annoying..... then we were only 3 bites into our order and she was offering us dessert!! How can you offer someone dessert who hasnt even finished the appetizer!?!?!?! Rushed RUSHED RUSHED.... \n\nHow do I know if I'm even going to have room for dessert I havent taken but 3 bites of my hamburger! When I told her NO I was not ready to order dessert - she took it upon herself to assume I didnt want any and she left a ticket and said ""here's your ticket no rush just let me know when your ready to go"" ....... We had NOT even started eating and she was pushing us out the door! Maybe we should have got it to go! \n\nMy friend ordered the Philly Cheese Steak, and Chili Cheese Fries - he said both were good. I had the Bacon Cheddar Burger and a side salad - the burger was greasy but tasted ok. It was nothing to get excited about. Still I felt Burger King has a better burger for $5.00 less then Johnny Rockets! Our bill was $33.00 which isnt bad but we could have gotten the same thing at any fast food joint for $15.00! But then of course we would have missed out on the band and dancing!! \n\nThe excitement of the evening was, about 5 minutes into our meal the little ""club"" thats sorta right out in the middle of the casino started up. It was country music, and a VERY interesting crowd of people! \n\nEven though you didnt want to go to a country bar, you just wanted to go to Johnny Rockets and eat a burger - you're suddenly right in the middle of a real hoedown YEEEE HAAWWWW rednecks festival.. for me it made me homesick, for my friend it just made him sick in general because he HATES country music, and cowboys, and that whole scene kind of made him laugh. ' \n\nBeing from Texas its almost instinct that I like country music, and country dancing, and can be pretty accepting of a 10 gallon Stetson hat if you catch me in the right mood! HOWEVER..... the one thing any good red blooded Texan will say is that IF your gonna dance the 2 step you CANNOT mess it up, or look like a jackrabbit tweaking on meth when you do it, or your gonna offend every Texan! The 2 step is like a sacred dance to the Hillbilly Gods and either do it right or DONT do it! \n\nLast night was just FUNNY it seems the line dance and tush push was the favorite dance of the night, maybe that's because no one there knew how to 2 step? I still cannot get the image of the woman who was doing an eclectic mix of country dancing and aerobics like dancing out of my head! \nIt was like umm...... she was confused was she at a country dance or jazzersize class? She didnt know! But boy she was having FUN!\n\nThen as the people had gotten a few drinks in them and the band started playing, they started TRYING to 2 step - Let me just say this...... If someone danced like that in Texas, THEY WOULD GET BEAT UP!!!! I was watching in HORROR, and actually became concerned for several of the people dancing afraid they had injured themselves! It was quite a sight to behold! \n\nKeep in mind - if you are ever attempting to 2-step the key to it is to SLIDE YOUR FEET - SLIDE THEM do not pick them up, do not do any kind of fancy foot work - if you can SLIDE YOUR FEET and count to 3 you CAN 2 step...... hahaha \n\nSo over all it was a fun time and this is how I rate it all... \n\nHamburger was good even with the grease \nService was rushed \nAtmosphere was crowded and loud \nMusic was good - the band was really good \nThe dancing was an embarrassment to all of mankind \n\nI now have a place to go when I want to people watch and get a good laugh! \n\nTo anyone who was dancing at the GSR last night - if you'd actually like to learn how to 2-step or at least not look like your having some kind of epileptic seizure while dancing please email me I will give you a free dance lesson!

Just be prepared!  4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service.  PS - steer clear of the spring rolls here - very bland with not much in them.  Pho is awesome though!",2013-10-20,05:33:52

My boyfriend and I went here today for lunch and boy were we disappointed!  Our first order - seared tuna nigiri - was mushy, metalic tasting, and served on a giant ball of rice.  The chef offered us a new piece, which was nice, but maybe they should have used the fresh piece to start with.  \n\nEverything we ate was subpar.  All the nigiri was served on gigantic overly compressed balls of overcooked rice and the long rolls and hand rolls were also just swimming in rice.  So much rice, in fact, that the rolls and handrolls fell apart as we ate them because there was just so much mushy overcooked rice!  Needless to say, we stopped eating before we were even full because there was just nothing very appetizing.  \n\nI'd recommend this place for the chinese food, but certainly not for sushi!",2010-06-29,05:23:57

Saturday night, 7:30pm, the restaurant is full with one available table and two seats at the bar.  We opted for the bar so we could watch the action!  \nOverall, the food was fine.  Not bad, but unfortunately, not spectacular either.  We started with the pickle plate and the hamachi crudo over pears.  The pickles were delicious (I think this was my favorite dish of the night) and I was pleasantly surprised by the pickled apples and pineapples!  Wish there had been more of them on the plate.  The hamachi was okay.. a little fishy which indicated to me that it wasn't the freshest.  And for $17, 5 thin slices of hamachi did not impress.  Next up was the chicken thigh from the grill, a grilled squid, and a king oyster mushroom.  The chicken was good and a bigger portion than I expected.  It was however lacking some flavor.  The grill marks were good and the smokey flavor was there (perhaps even a little too charred), but the marinade was lacking.  Unfortunately, I felt the same way about the squid and the mushroom.  Not the freshest and lacking flavor.  It was so bland that instead of finishing this course off we decided to try another dish - perhaps we had just ordered wrong.  Insert duck fried rice.  Lots of flavor here - and those cracklins were spot on!  I've never had crispy crunches in my fried rice before but that was a winner.  However, for the price and the portion size, I felt a little ripped off.  \nOut the door was $100 for 2 women, each of us had 1 glass of sake and the above shared plates.  In my book, it was not worth the $100.  It was a fun experience, the restaurant vibe is great, but for the prices the food could use some upgrading.",2016-12-12,05:11:48

Went in on a Tuesday night to get a quick dinner before heading to the airport.  Went in around 7pm and we were the ONLY ones in the entire restaurant.  This usually makes me uncomfortable, and there is usually a reason that the restaurant was empty, but against my better judgement, we decided to stay because we were hungry and didn't have much time.  I ordered the chicken in a yellow sauce ($11) and my boyfriend ordered a grilled steak, cooked rare ($13) .  Chips were served to us after ordering with a tasteless white cream sauce.  Upon asking for the famous green sauce, they said they ran out of it.  How can you run out of something if no one is in the restaurant?  Maybe they just aren't making it anymore.. :(.  When our meal arrived, my chicken was absolutely tasteless!  No amount of hot sauce or salt and pepper could even help it.  I ate it because I was starving, but I am sad to report that it was one of the worst meals I've ever had in a restaurant.  My boyfriends steak was PAPER thin and cooked well done.  Honestly, the steak was probably about 1/4lb of meat and for $13.. what a joke!  It was tasty but tough because it was so overcooked.  When the waitress came over to ask how our food was we said, ""Honestly, not very good"" and she said, ""oh, okay"" and walked away without any apology or offer to provide something else.

So I ended up with a bison burger instead with a side of sweet potato fries.  Holy Smokes-their burgers are delicious.  I was expecting as much, given that if you're going to name your restaurant after a sandwich, they should be delectable.  Sweet potato fries were ok but definitely not the best I'd ever had.

Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two ""stalls"" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.

She had it before in Morocco and wanted to see what this restaurant was like. \n\nThis place is right off of South street, which made for some difficulty parking. However, we decided on a late dinner at 7:15pm or so, and so got lucky with close parking spots. The service was super duper friendly, although not extremely fast. This did not really bother us as I get the impression that Moroccan culture makes a meal a slow experience in itself. Although we found out later that all our servers and even the owner were not Moroccan. However, do not worry, the chef is (and is not that the most important part? hahaha). \n\nWe had coupons so we had to order the Fez Feast (7 courses). We started out with a trio of cold salads. They were all very good. There was a cucumber salad, a carrot salad and eggplant concoction. This was served with all you can eat warm bread, which was delicious. The servers bring by the bread in this gigantic woven basket; I felt a bit bad on how often I asked them to bring us bread, but it really was delicious. Then we had a puff pastry with a meat like mixture. I have to admit neither I nor my companion really cared for this. The dish was sprinkled with powdered sugar, and meat and powdered sugar just did not work for me. \n\nWe both had the olive lemon chicken (I think you had a choice of several different types of chicken, but it was hard to understand the server). The chicken was fairly tender, but the dish overall was too salty for me. The server asked if we would like it mild or spicy and we decided on mild. However, he made the ingenious suggestion of getting the spices on the side so we could at least try it. The server informed me that there was harissa in the spices, which is an ingredient I have been dying to try. The spices ended up being too spicy for me, but I was really glad to have gotten the chance to try the harissa, and the flavor was quite good. \n\nThe fourth course was a choice between beef kabobs and honey almond lamb. My companion and I ended up split over this choice; she got the kabobs and I got the lamb. She was generous enough to allow me to try her kabob, which consisted of green peppers, onions (I think) and 3 chunks of beef. I did not really think it was anything special. It did not really seem specially seasoned or flavored. The lamb, however, was quite tasty. I was a little disappointed as the lamb was not super tender and the honey taste did not seem really infused into the meat. But overall, it was a pretty tasty dish. I had this same (I believe) dish YEARS ago after finishing my first year of undergraduate education. I remembered it being amazing. Of course that was years ago, and memories get warped throughout the years. So I liked this dish but was a bit disappointed because it did not live up to the memories. \n\nThe fifth dish was a couscous with roasted vegetables. There is not much to say. It was okay, a bit bland, but okay. I know my companion thought it was a bit too dry. There were a lot of good vegetables in there, however. \n\nI am not sure how they counted the last few courses. There was fruit that was brought to us in a basket. A generous 6 pieces; two each of apples, bananas and oranges. It does not sound like much, but considering how much food preceded this, we were full just looking at the fruit. There was also a very, very delicious cup of sweetened mint tea. This was followed by an eclair looking pastry. I found the pastry to be a great light and sweet ending to the meal. \n\nMy biggest complaint and word of caution is that later at night it seems like a lot of customers come for the hookah. Since I am allergic to smoke and the dining area is one big long room with nowhere to hide, this was a problem. I would say, if you think that the hookah will bother you to come earlier in the evening. When we first got to the restaurant, there was traditional Moroccan sounding music playing, later when the hookah customers came, the music all of a sudden changed to a disco-techy musical selection. I guess they think hookah goes better with disco-techy music. Hahaha",2010-04-08,06:08:33

Supposedly they take 3 days to make. So I was really excited when my sister let me talk her into coming despite the fact that we were really busy in the middle of moving her out of her apartment. (Thanks, sis!) \n\nThe place was very noisy with about 3 birthdays. I really admire the stamina of the wait staff, there was a lot of loud singing and even dancing. The wait staff generally seemed very nice and the manager even came out to ask us to do a survey. I thought the food came out a bit on the slow side, but then it is a steakhouse, and we were so exhausted from the moving that I can not 100% vouch for my sense of time. \n\nNeedless to say I ordered the ribs (with a side house salad and mashed potatoes). Prior to ordering, there is a good sized pail of peanuts on the table and homemade rolls with cinnamon and honey butter is served. The peanuts are nice, and I mention them for those with peanut allergies planning on visiting this place. But the true star were those soft and warm rolls. As one can imagine, the cinnamon and honey butter really helped matters too. \n\nMy salad came out first, and I was really impressed, for a small side salad, it was a pretty good size with lots of great ingredients. It had a good amount of eggs, tomatoes, cheese and crouton. The croutons were supposedly homemade and tasted like it. When the rest of my food came out., I was really excited. Unfortunately, then came the crash. The ribs, although falling off the bone, were on the dry side. There really was not much BBQ sauce on it, and a lot of smokiness. I know some people like as much smokiness as they can get, but I prefer just a hint. I should mention that the mashed potatoes were good, but the portion was on the small side.",2009-09-08,04:40:38

Service is slow and inattentive.  Our waiter served everyone around us their main meals while we watched hungrily, even though we ordered before them!  He was also difficult to get his attention.  Service was extremely slow - we ended up at Roux 3 for over 2.5 hours.  (-1 STAR).  \n\nMaybe that's what Roux 3 means?  Expect an almost 3 hour meal???\n\nThe food is good but not great.  I ordered a very nice glass of Spanish Rioja - Temparanillo Infinitus '06.  This paired really well with my steak.  For starters, I had the squash soup ($6).  This was excellent.  I loved the brioche croutons.  \n\nFor my main meal, I ordered a medium 8 oz Flank Steak for $22.  It came out medium-rare.  It was served over a layer of overly salted spinach and a small serving of mashed potatoes.  The plate was very warm but the steak was cold.  I know the difference of a steak that just came off a grill versus what I had, which tasted like it had been sitting out for at least 5 minutes after cooking.  I ate with two other colleagues, only one was offered fresh ground pepper for her salad.  I was not (-0.5 STARS). For dessert, (I was originally going to skip) I asked for what was available in the ice cream department a la carte and was answered with ""only vanilla"" from our waiter Jared.  Strangely, there's carmel and espresso ice cream listed in the menu but it can't be ordered separately.  (-1 STAR) \n\nRoux 3 has lots of potential.  Great ambiance, good food, dim lighting, interesting local Italian inspired landscape art, decent wine card, and good desserts.  Total damage $120 before tip.  I'd come back but only because the company is paying for it.  Excellent if you're in the neighborhood and want a classy and upscale place to eat that isn't bar food - just don't expect the service to be fast or great.",2007-11-07,02:09:19

From the brusque greeting we got upon entering the restaurant, to the twenty minutes it took to cash out the check before we could leave, we spent our entire time in Zagol feeling totally unwelcome.  When we were seated, there were only a few other people there, but several groups came in after us and many of them were getting their food orders taken before we had even seen the waitress.  It got so bad that when she went to help the table next to us, they spoke up and told her, ""That other table has been here a lot longer than us.""  Thanks, other people!  If you hadn't been so kind, we might still be sitting there!  Ordering our drinks turned into a long list of what they were out of that night.  Even so, we should have each ordered multiple drinks because once we got our food, she disappeared again, leaving us to eat a pile of spicy food WITH NO WATER REFILLS!  To highlight all of this, the dining room was too cold.  Most of the people in the restaurant left their coats on at the table.  Bad form, Zagol.  I know heating that big space must be pricey, but that's one of the costs of doing business.  Pump up the thermostat a bit.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the service, we probably would have really enjoyed our meal.  We tried the Key Wat, Beg Tibs, and Mesir Wat.  Everything we ate was delicious, and the flavors quite different from anything else available in town.  We enjoyed eating with the Injera, although about halfway through the meal it became a bit too much, and I just wanted to finish off the remainder of the food with a fork.  We would have asked for utensils at that point if we had someone to ask.  Daughter was particularly fond of eating with her hands: a warning to other parents, though--if your kid isn't into spicy food, they probably will be very unhappy here.\n\nOverall, we probably won't be back, which is unfortunate, since Zagol has a tasty offering, and Reno is really lacking for diversity in ethnic foods.

Originally, we wanted to eat here because they advertise that they deliver.  (Yay!  Delivery!)  We tried to call in, figuring that if they didn't deliver to our house we could at least put in an order for take-out.  Husband called, only to hear a click.  ""Hmmm...must be a bad connection.""

If you don't believe me, take a look at the picture on their web-site.  And it was not good sauce.  It tastes like liquefied cinnamon buns.  It was seriously that sweet.  I say again, blech.  And my pulled pork sandwich was CHOPPED pork, not shredded.  I tried Husband's ribs, which were nice and tender but maybe that was because they soaked up SO MUCH SAUCE!

And since they share a space with a Port o' Subs, it would be like a one-stop shop.  ""Who wants sandwiches?!""  So I brought home a 12"" BBQ pork sandwich for Husband and I to share, along with an order of spring rolls and pot stickers (totaling over $20--ouch!)\n\nWhat a disappointment!  The sandwich had good bread--fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside--and the pork had decent flavor, but that is where the flavor ended...the cilantro was wilted and flavorless, and all of the other layers of flavor that make banh mi so delectable were missing.  And even though I specifically said that I wanted EVERYTHING on it (""Jalapenos, too?""  ""Oh yes, definitely jalapenos""), they left off the jalapenos.  It basically tasted like meat on bread.  The spring rolls weren't much better.  They were overstuffed with way too much rice noodles, which overpowered the other flavors in the roll and made the whole thing taste starchy.  The pot stickers weren't bad, but not good enough to make up for the rest of the meal.\n\nI might be back to try their pho--Husband really wants a shot at the duck pho--but overall I don't think Viet Pho will be getting much more of our business.

We have been conditioned to only choose El Tumi for a meal if we have lots of extra time to kill.  We have basically accepted that the Huacatay has a price, and that price is time.  But last night was really the clincher.  We showed up for dinner, and we were the second table in the room; about 20 minutes after us, another two-top came in, making seven total guests to serve.  There were three people working in the kitchen, including our server, who was back there helping out while leaving us to sit server-free.  It took three people over 45 minutes (from the time we ordered) to serve seven guests (all of our food came out at the same time). And all that time we did not get any acknowledgement that there was any kind of unusual wait...not even a refill on our chips or our water.  \n\nNope.  I just can't do that anymore.  Sorry, El Tumi, but we have to break up.",2014-09-24,15:36:11

They are trying to bring a little more upscale drinking other than beer an the other few smoke filled bars in the area.

I felt super let down, but i still hadn't gotten to the fries.\n\nI had the truffle fries and i LOVED them... at first. The texture was perfect, the seasoning was just right, but something about the truffle flavor lingered long past it was welcome. It wasnt overwhelming, but truffle flavor permeated the next few bites of burger, sips of (delicious) cherry soda, even stuck around through my after-lunch cigarette. I still tasted truffle in the back of my mouth later that night when i was drinking beers with my friends. It was weird. \n\nI am giving 500 degrees three stars because i am sure their other fries are yummy.

Again, no, a very unapologetic one at that. Rally? Not even a dollar? You have my money so how can you be losing by throwing me a small bone to get me in the door at least once?

Check in was a breeze! Then came finding my room. This hotel is actually a mini city. You WILL get lost. The app is no help. It's great if you're trying to get those FitBit steps in. \n\nI found my room in a nice little corridor. I booked a standard room within the conference block that I was with. The room itself didn't appear bad at first glance. I even had a room with a view to the outdoor pool. My stay was during April and it wasn't open yet. \n\nSuddenly things took a turn for the worst. That day the toilet overflowed, construction was going on throughout the hotel and it occurred in several rooms. The group that I was with arranged a night outting. Many of us came back to being locked out of our rooms. We were ALL told different reasons. I was told my key was the issue (it was made by one of the sponsors of the event), another person was told their balance wasn't paid (it wasn't true), someone else was told they didn't have her name on the guest list and therefore locked her key. They were ALL incorrect. After 4 hours, 3 keys and 2 security guards I was finally able to get to my room at 1:05am. I had to be at the conference at 7:30am. UGH!\n\nI didn't spend too much time in my room that first day but the next day is when I noticed that the pillows smelled like mildew. I couldn't sleep because the smell was so awful. I called house keeping for new ones. They brought me 4 smaller ones that were on their last fluff. Whatever, at least they didn't stink. \n\nThe next day I noticed that housekeeping had NOT removed the stinky pillows. Instead they had placed them back up on the bed and left the non stinky ones on the floor! WTF?? This is when I called front desk. The refunded me $40 from my bill. Ok. At least they somewhat tried. \n\nFrom their appearance you would think you're staying at a luxurious resort but their customer service is not up to par.

Our primary physician, Dr. Charles Kaplan referred her to the Pain Institute of Southern Arizona (PISA), specifically Dr. Gossler.  She was apprehensive about what to expect because she had never been to a pain clinic before.  Dr. Gossler is a very caring, informative doctor.  He spent time examining her, asking her lots of questions, reviewing her MRI and ultimately determined that she needed to have some injections in between some of her discs.  The injections contained steroids plus some medicine to help with inflammation and pain. \n\nThe morning of the injections, she was not to eat or drink anything and needed me to be there to drive her home afterwards.  Her appointment was at 9:00 a.m.  We arrived about 15 till and they took her back at 10 after 9:00 (not too bad a wait).  She laid on a table with her head face down into a hole, like they use at massage places.  They started with cleaning her back off and then the doctor began with local anesthesia shots.  She said they didn't hurt, just a little sting.  Then he began the actual injections. Dr. Gossler was very attentive during the procedure, always checking to see how she was doing and if she was in any pain.  His voice is very soft and calming.  The injections themselves didn't hurt.  She did feel some slight pressure, she said it felt like they were trying to put air in a tire and kept putting more air in even after it was full.  Afterwards, she was helped to a very comfortable chair in the recovery area, had her blood pressure checked, offered water to drink and again monitored to see how she was doing. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, she was cleared to leave.  She was able to walk by herself from the recovery area to the car.  The entire procedure took less than 45 minutes. It was hard for my wife to tell if the injections were successful because so so much time had passed since the pain started until the time she got the injections (miscommunication in the primary physicians office), time itself seemed to have taken care of some of the worst pain.  But after a week or so, she was pain free from this sciatica for 6 months before it returned out of the blue. \n\nThe second time, she immediately called the pain clinic directly and was able to get in the next morning for injections.  Unfortunately, the injections didn't seem to help this time.  She felt some initial relief the day of the injections but not much afterwards.  In a consultation a couple weeks later with Dr. Gossler, he suggested that they try a different area (the joint itself) to apply injections.  My wife opted against having this done, not because of anything that Dr. Gossler did or said but just the fact that everything she read about sciatica, special exercises and time seem to be the most successful way to treat the pain. \n\nThe office did call our home several times to check to see how my wife was doing.   She really liked the staff and Dr. Gossler and would recommend them to anyone who is in pain and needs relief.  While she does not think it ultimately helped her specific situation, she does feel that Dr. Gossler is a wonderful caring doctor that will do everything within his power to provide the relief needed for pain.  He seems to really understand what it is like to be in pain and how much it impacts your every day life.",2013-11-11,22:44:00

It took a few visits to get used to this place.  We have to watch them add the ingredients so that they do not add too much.

However for meat toppings, we generally like more than they like to give, so we learned to ask for double.  Once we learned this, we can now come out with a decent pizza to our liking.  We recommend watching the cook time closely when cooking these pizzas the first few times, because with a thin crust it can get burned easily.  Just watching the toppings and cheese on top can be misleading and we found our cook time for our range is less than their printed instructions.\n\nThe last time we tried the free dessert pizza no one much cared for it so I think we will decline the offer next time.

We went over around 7:30pm and asked the hostess for a seat on the front patio. \n\nHere's the interesting part, a group of 4 was not large enough to seat at any of their 6-person tables of which there were at least 6 available, already set and ready to go. We were told that we could wait 15-20 minutes and, if there were still tables available, that they would seat us. They referred to the tables as being reserved and when asked told us that they weren't reserved by anyone but rather that they were holding them in case larger groups arrived... and wanted to sit outside in 90 degree muggy weather... when there was a festival with music playing at the other end of downtown.\n\nTo be fair, there were a few 4-person tables on the patio but all were taken... including one with only one person lounging with his feet on the chair next to him with an empty glass and a newspaper. When asked why he was allowed a four-person table the answer was simply that they didn't have smaller tables. Wtf!?! Don't tell us that 4 people isn't satisfactory for seating at a 6-top but that you'll happily seat one guy not even drinking or eating at a 4-top. And for the record, the single person seating on a night that you are turning people away is at the bar!!!!\n\nWe waited around long enough for me to talk with a manager and ask for a little sympathy and he basically told me to shove off if I didn't like the way the hostess handled things. Done and done Schlafly Bottleworks. I will personally never bother you again with my money. Being a brewery in St. Louis is hardly a unique offering. There are plenty of great options and you just lost 4 customers who apparently fail to meet your seating-eligible requirements. WATER STREET which had significantly better food and delicious cocktails was delighted to seat us immediately without any games or snubberery, treated us with the respect a customer actually deserves and very graciously accepted the money that we had intended to spend at your establishment.",2016-07-09,15:14:09

The stuffed grape leaves were quite good but the saganaki was bland and undercooked despite the rave reviews from so many others. Unfortunately, it was also what I had been looking forward to the most but the cheese wasn't particularly cooked and was rubbery without any of the gooeyness one expects.

The bbq pork sandwich is ok.  My main complaints are that the sesame bun is too soft, the chunks of pork are too big (and they aren't really juicy like what you'd expect pulled pork to be), the sauce is too sweet, and there isn't enough coleslaw (only a mouthful is placed on top of the meat, booooo).  We have tried the raw bar here too which is just ok as well.\n\nHowever, I take off a star for how horrible of an experience it is just to get a seat each time I have come here for dinner whether it's closer to 5 or closer to 9pm (I didn't have to wait for lunch for 2 at 3:15pm, but for some reason the hostess still could not seat us promptly and seemed pretty confused at the prospect of seating us).  The dinnertime hostess SUCKS.  She either doesn't know what it means to be a hostess or hates her job and refuses to do it.  They always tell you some absurd wait time if you keep pushing since they're so vague and work so slowly (1 hr 45 min is a common number they use)--is this a strategy to deter people from bombarding this place?  One saving grace is that they'll take your number and will call you once your table is ready (which never takes as long as they claim).  I also think the seating arrangement sucks because there are a few booths that are quite nice if you have a big group (more than 4 ppl) but the tables are round so sharing food becomes difficult.  Otherwise, you are left staring at another couple throughout your meal.  There are plenty of bar seats which are always filled and then there is this weird back area that is just a shafted space. (And why is there this counter that runs all the way to the back of the restaurant that takes up space but serves no purpose? You can't stand there with your drink because the wait staff, hostess and customers going to the bathroom would constantly make you move).

The short rib mac n cheese might not have been the best choice for a 1pm meal on a rainy Sunday on an empty stomach, but my bf chose the more safe eggs benedict with smoked salmon and the latter was delicious (although we would've preferred for the English muffin to be toasted).  The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was yummy but not too overpowering (and just the right amount was poured over the dish).  The side salad was fine (the greens were fresh and crisp and there were bits of grape tomatoes and red onion) but the ""home fries"" were an odd mix between potato chips and home fries--way too much butter overall but lots of flavor.  He also ordered what seemed to be freshly squeezed orange juice and he loved the layers of extra pulp in each gulp.  The mac n cheese uses 5 diff cheeses, not sure what they are since they're not listed, but they don't mix well.  The dish overall was too watery for me and the macaroni was overcooked and added nothing to the dish, unfortunately.  I like my pasta al dente and the cheese shouldn't be like pure liquid.  Also, the short rib pieces were tiny but tender, but in the overall dish, their flavor added too much of a sweet and pungent punch to the otherwise pretty mundane dish.\n\nOur server was very nice but like the general decor, the wait staff look like they're about to welcome a rowdy Saturday night with lots of revelers than a quiet Sunday brunch.  There were 2 other parties there so the restaurant was very quiet, but the restaurant was playing loud rock music which was not too pleasing.  I like the artwork on the walls but the whole place comes of a little dingy...possibly because of the poor lighting?  Not sure.  But if they install some more lights, I think the place could convert well to a brunch/lunch spot.  Otherwise, the furniture and large bar area make this place more like a late night spot than a chill place to grab some lunch.",2010-09-26,22:27:49

The service was decent and the food seemed to always be fresh. As far as service goes, there was no much interaction with employees past paying for your meal and getting our drink cup, which happened during the same time. You basically put your dirty plates in a tub by a door that I assume leads back to the kitchen or dish room. This limits your interaction with the service, so leaving tips might not seem needed, but that is completely up to you.

Some were easily twice the size of normal oysters\n- Delicious cocktails: Seeing as they were half off because of HH, I indulged and got both the Champagne au Peche (Champagne and fresh peach puree) and the St. Charles Streetcar (St. Germain, pear vodka, Champagne). Both were tasty and refreshing\n\nCons:\n- The Reveillon menu left a lot to be desired. For the first course, my boyfriend got the shrimp remoulade and I got the crispy sweetbread with beluga lentils and blood orange brown butter vinaigrette. The remoulade was flavorless and forgettable. The sweetbread was actually well-cooked (very crisp) but got to be too rich after a while.\n- The turtle soup and seafood gumbo that made up our second course were both terrible. There was maybe a kernel of turtle meat in the entire bowl of soup and the gumbo lacked seasoning. Our third course consisted of crispy flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp and mirliton dressing, and a rib roast with oyster dressing, turnip and apple puree, and cherry compote. - \n- The roast was decent if a bit chewy, but the flounder was so rich that my boyfriend couldn't finish it. \n- Our final course was dessert--bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream and hot buttered pecan sauce for him, apple tart with caramel and praline ice-cream for me. The praline ice-cream was great, but the bread pudding was too sweet in my opinion and the apple tart was virtually inedible on account of being too dry.\n- Service was also disappointing for a restaurant with this reputation. Our server was nice enough, but she would disappear for long blocks of time during inopportune moments when we really needed her\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I did a Reveillon dinner in NOLA, but I don't think I'll be recommending Luke to anyone.",2013-01-03,07:22:07

After reading other Yelper's reviews, I decided to go back today with several coworkers. I came at this with a different frame of mind.  Zaxby's is not the place you go to eat healthy, nor do they claim to be.  I came at it as Zaxby's vs Chick-Fil-A.  And in that respect, I decided to revise my rating. \n\nI still prefer Chick-Fil-A, but there is a lot to like at Zaxby's. I got their Nibblers plate today, and also ordered cheese bites, fried pickles and Texas toast to share.  I still think the deep frier needs some work. The fries could be crispier.  The cole slaw was good, and I am a fan of the cheese bites. \n\nThe chicken was good.  I find Chick-Fil-A's to be juicier.  But it wasn't bad at all, certainly not deserving of the 1 star review I gave it before. \n\nSo, bottom line, although I expect to go to Chick-Fil-A more often, I would not hesitate to stop here if the opportunity presented itself.

A local supermaket, Publix, carries Tsunami sushi, and since it tastes so good at Publix, I assumed that the sushi would taste good at Tsunami sushi, and I was WRONG!\n\nI had some eggrolls for an appetizer, which were decent, but nothing too special. You shouldn't bother paying the five dollars for them.\n\nThe sushi here was pretty bland, even my personal favorite the California, in freshness was not able to even remotely capture my taste buds at all. I tired some other rolls there like their Volcano Rolls and Philadelphia Rolls, but both were a disappointment and overall WASTE OF MONEY for the heavy price the restaurant charges.\n\nMy step-father, George Saunders, had their Korean Super Spicy dish and I must say that it was kickin'. I could smell it all the way from my side of the table, it left him feeling pretty sick the next day, but thats his own fault haha. \n\nOverall the bill was around $60, which wouldn't be bad if the sushi was great, but since it wasn't this place was a waste of time, and I would have been better off just going to Publix and buying the sushi from there!

This was the tiniest sliver of protein I may have ever seen on a $9 sandwich. The bread was white and just okay, not crusty. The whole sandwich needed some serious pizzazz to bring it up, but it lacked condiments and I didn't see any anywhere in the place. The side dish was potato salad, a very small scoop of bland stuff. To be fair, I added an extra side of slaw, and the tangy dressing was tasty, though the portion, again, was miniscule. A cup of latte was excellent, though pricey at $3.50.\nThey serve water in clear bottles, but with no ice. So if you want it cold, you'd better ask. I'm not sure how this will play in hot weather.

Not much closest space which made it hard for 3 people to hang up their clothes for 5 days of a business conference. \n\nMost hotels now put a mirror over the desk area in the living space so multiple people can get ready at once. These rooms only had one long mirror outside the bathroom not close to a table.\n\nThe only bad thing about staying in the French Quarter is it is loud... always... even on the 14th floor. We had homeless men outside the hotel playing ""drums"" that we heard loud and clear on the 14th floor. \n\nEmployees were very helpful when we were checking out.

Quite a few folks say the fried food is above average.  I agree.\n\nThe service is adequate.  The wait staff is friendly for sure but sometimes it feels a little slow.

They might be #1 but not by much.  A double patty burger, fries and a fountain drink is going to break $10 in each place.  It's probably a little less here but you'll get a normal portion of fresh fries instead of the ridiculous mountain you get at 5 Guys.  The burgers are about the same size.\n\nFinally for taste I'm going to go #3 but once again not by much.  My burger was fresh and juicy and my fries were hot and crispy.  I don't know if you care but they serve the Pepsi line of fountain drinks as opposed to Coke.

An early lunch would hit the spot.  I was the first customer in the door at 11:00 am.  \n\nI sat at the beautiful bar and ogled the dozens of taps.  A tag on the bar said my bartenders would be Abby & Kim and Abby created me quickly.  She also was worth a little ogling.  It turns out she is also a Phillies Ball Girl!  I quickly received my first delicious craft beer from an impressive list.  Most of them run about $5.  \n\nI told Abby I needed a couple of minutes with the menu and off she went.  Things went a little downhill at this point.  I was ready to order and there was no Abby and no Kim and a hungry slightly annoyed Yelper.

We talked beers for a while and both were knowledgeable.\n\nThis is one of those places where if you are at the bar and running a tab, they hold your credit card.  Of course I have had that happen before and I will forever be annoyed when a place does that.  I like to keep control of my plastic!\n\nMy Bistro Burger arrived nicely plated.  The toasted ciabatta bun is very impressive and really enhances the sandwich.  My burger was cooked as requested and delicious.  The accompanying fries were forgettable and I completely expected that.  Miller's is a chain and my experience with chains is that fries are rarely anything special.  I was never asked if I wanted S&P or ketchup so I requested them.  After that, between the two of them, they must have asked me ten times if I needed anything else!

Obviously, I expected the crowds and the hoopla.   I came prepared for that.    It comes with the territory.  So I would think the staff would be equally as prepared.  You know, because they work at a movie theatre.  \n\nWell, first - apparently the theatre is having an identity crisis.  I ordered my tickets online and was informed that it was an AMC theatre instead.  However, when I arrived, the building still donned the Loews moniker.  Whatever.  What was bizarre was that half the staff wore AMC shirts, some others Loews, and some went shirtless! \n\nJust kidding. No one went shirtless.  But I told you, this is the dramatic version.  \n\n*kickline*\n\nI retrieve my ticket from the kiosk and am truly shocked by the number of people waiting in long, slow lines to buy tickets.  I'm even more shocked by the number of people expressing their surprise when, while waiting in the aforementioned long, slow lines, they find out their movie of choice had sold out.    Dude.  Computers?  They work.  \n\n*big chorus number*\n\nI have about twenty-five minutes until the advertised start time of the movie, so i decide it's high time for a pretzel and a medium diet coke.  I had allotted $10 to spend on movie snacks, and that combination was offered at the low price of $9.75.  I'm so good with budgeting! And math!   I wait in what seemed like a pretty small line to order my treats, and it becomes increasingly obvious that my line is hardly moving at all.  \n\n*sappy ballad*\n\nMy seats have already been procured and I'm furiously checking the time every minute or so and I'm realizing that I'm definitely going to miss the previews.  Now, most people would have just left the line, right?  Just given up on the pretzel and diet coke.  Not me.  I am stubborn and the movie was slated to be over two hours long.  I needed *something*.     And just as I receive a text message that the previews are over and the movie is starting, it is finally my turn in line.\n\n*dramatic monologue from lead actor in tights*\n\nI order my pretzel and diet coke and find out that the pretzel is actually ""pretzel bites"" and that she'd, you know, be right back.  Because she had no idea if there were any in stock.  Heh.   Before she left, she took out a cup and started filling it with diet coke.  She took so long to come back that it overflowed, someone else came around and grabbed it, and likely gave it to another customer.  \n\n*cue the orchestra*\n\nShe returns to tell me that the coveted pretzel bites would be ready in three to four minutes.  It is at this point that I ask if there's anything else in the same price range as the pretzel bites.  She looks at me like i asked her to join me on a trip to the United Kingdom by car.    She said that the pretzel bites were the only item for $5.00.  I finally was able to explain to her that I would go lower.   We decided on a small popcorn.   She suddenly looked even more perplexed.  Wasn't there a drink there?  What happened to the diet coke?!\n\n*all cast comes out on stage for final dance number*\n\nShe prepares another cup of soda for me and hands me my popcorn and realizes that she owes me a quarter.   She peered over my head to view the angry line behind me.  She looked down at the register.  She probably had absolutely no clue how to open the register without making a new sale.  \n\n""Do you want the quarter?""\n""It's yours.""\n\nI took my items and ran into the theatre and sank down into some really comfortable seats and enjoyed the movie (I missed the first 10 minutes) and my delicious diet coke and popcorn.  Seriously, the seats were fabulous.  And the theatre was clean and the sound was pretty great and at least I have a  story to tell about the counter staff.  \n\n*curtain*",2008-06-02,04:39:26

I've been in there and listened as one of the proprietors has gone into great detail with a customer about some varietal or another and its qualities and how one year is different than another, educating that customer on the subtle differences that make one year superb and another merely so-so.\nSo if I was into wine, I'd give this place 4 stars or maybe 5.\n\nBut when it comes to barley,  corn and wheat (or rye), virgin charred maple barrels and the lusciousness that is bourbon, they are just fair. Their selection is average, their price points higher than some, lower than others.\n\nI will agree with Claire B that their location leaves something to be desired, but once you know where it is, I'm sure that those who love wine will know where to find it again.

Things weren't looking up.\n\nThen I saw how many beers were on tap. 30+ beers on tap. Holy Moly. I ended up drinking a Guinness and a Blue Moon. The Blue Moon was pretty good, but the Guinness tasted like they hadn't cleaned the lines in a while.\n\nThe jukebox had a good selection of tunes, including The Beastie Boys, Flogging Molly, Allman Brothers and more. I also enjoyed playing Photo Hunt with Ms. Cupcake Queen, Dan the Fireman, Bill M, and some guy from Birmingham whose name escapes me(Eric?).\n\nMy only other gripes were that they needed to mop the floor around the urinal a little more, since it smelled like Eau D' City Hall train stop. That and they had NO frickin' TP, which made for an awkward ride home on the train.\n\nOh yeah, they also have a 20 dollar minimum charge for credit/debit cards so be forewarned.

Not very chocolatey, not very sweet. And it had a funny aftertaste to it.\n\nService was pretty slow. The two kids behind the counter didn't seem real organized/didn't work well together.

I was a little annoyed that no one asked me if I wanted anything to drink and I had to wait until later to actually place that order. Also there didn't seem to be a set person taking orders, as one of the ladies in the back came up and took my order while an older gentleman chewed the fat with one of the locals sitting at the main counter.\n     My sandwich and salad arrived within a reasonable time span.

It didn't taste like it was made from canned tomatillos, but it definitely hadn't been made in a while because there was no fresh tangy taste with plenty of garlic. It just kinda sat on the enchiladas. Also it was a bit watery for my taste. \n\nService was pretty decent and both the waitress and the bartender were both friendly.\n\nIts sad, this place had potential.

I made a few nice pickups from a couple of artist that I like at very reasonable prices (3.98 and under for almost perfect records). \n\nThe music they played there ranged from some godawful PR singer attempting to sing ""I""m a believer"" to David Bowie while the upstairs guy listened to some talk radio show guy talk about UFO sightings. So I was alternately feeling like vomiting or doing drugs(just kidding, a little Bowie joke. Who goes to Berlin to kick heroin?).\n\nAnyways, I digressed.

Their menu is not very user friendly. My main issue was the disturbingly low occurrence of guacamole on it. I scanned the menu for something with guacamole on it, as I wanted whatever that would be (avocados being present on a menu item is usually how I decide what I'm going to pick). Nothing seemed to come with guac. Could I add guac to my meal? I had no idea how much it would cost since there was no mention of add ons, so I refrained. Perhaps it would have given my naked beef burrito (everything but the tortilla) some more flair. \n\nAnother gripe about the menu: be clear if ""beef"" means ground beef or steak.

I was surprised by how much seating they have, and liked that most of the options are booths. Many families were inside chowing down on the inexpensive food. \n\nWe started with a pepperoni pizza as an appetizer (yeah, we're fat) just so everyone could get a slice and experience the restaurant's namesake offering. The pizza is good, although have others have commented it's not your typical New York style but rather ""Greek style"" which from what I can tell means a puffy crust and tons of cheese. \n\nFor dinner, everyone in my group went with an entree. I was tickled when reading the menu because it says all entrees come with MELTED CHEESE, salad (which never arrived), and garlic bread. We anxiously waited to see if we'd each be presented with a side dish of melted cheese. When our food came out, we quickly realized what they meant -- each dish was cloaked in a thick blanket of cheese, making one dish indistinguishable from the next. I'm not complaining since cheese is like oxygen to me, but if you're lactose intolerant you best not be ordering one of these dishes. \n\nMy chicken parm was served over spaghetti. It was satisfying and I ended up taking about 3/4 of it home. I tried my friend's eggplant rollatini which was also quite tasty. The garlic bread was not worth eating (but I did anyway, because... carbs.)\n\nThe decor in this place is incredibly random and unintentionally kitschy. Table placemats are covered in ads, which included ads for a bail bondsman, pawn shop and critter removal (which really gets your appetite working). There are framed posters throughout the restaurant which range from a knock off of the Last Supper (seriously, it wasn't even a print of the real thing just a completely different rendition with JC sitting on his own side of the table -- most likely eating Greek pizza but I didn't look close enough), a 300 movie poster, a map of the world, St Pete sunset, and many more. My motivation for coming back will most likely be to better inspect the entire poster collection. It was totally bizarre and wonderful. \n\nAlso weird is that you're given a ""check"" which is really just a take out menu with everything you ordered circled on it, and you're not given the total.

Should my star rating be based upon comparing Sam's to all Sports Bars in which I have ever been?  Or, should it be a comparison to Nashville Sports Bars?\n\nI chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  The sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.\n\nSam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  I really like Sam's and I really like the patio in Spring, Summer, and early Autumn.  But, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... Sam's is just mediocre.  \n\nThe service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.  I'm sorry.\n\nThe food is on the better side of bar fare.  But their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  The mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.\n\nBut, hey, it's a bar.  It has lots of TVs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.

Seriously, part of the review for a BBQ place lately seems to be as much about swinging around your own *um* ""weight"" as it is talking about the 'Q.\n\nYes, I have had negative customer service experiences at Edley's including the phone conversation listed below.  And, to be honest, I have continued to have a range of customer service experiences from negative to average (but never above average, mind you).  This is important to mention because when you go to Edley's don't expect good service.  I'm not sure they're capable.  If you pick up Edley's To-Go, also don't expect good service.  I'm not sure they're capable of it there either.\n\nI love things that are smoked.  Is it a meat?  Smoke it.  Is it a vegetable?  Smoke it.  Is it a dessert?  Well, sh*t, smoke it too.  God (Allah, Krishna, Buddha, etc.) bless smoked foods.  What do they do well at Edley's and what do they do poorly...\n\nIt's the 4th of July, so let's start with the positives:\n*  Pulled Pork\nIt is tender.  It is moist, not dry.  The ""hot"" sauce is tasty, but unfortunately not ""hot' enough for my tastes - well, not really hot at all.\n*  Smoked Turkey\nAgain, you were doing something right when you made your smoked turkey.  You were hitting it just right and with the right timing with the mopping sauce.  You kept it moist, you didn't dry it out... well played.\n* Beans\nI find your bean medley... interesting.  I don't know whether to classify this as a positive or a negative.  I would classify it as a ""taken aback"".  It was different for sure.\n\nThe negatives about the food:\n*  BBQ brisket sandwich\nSee Jason S.'s review from 5/25/2012.  The description is spot on.  I expected to be smitten... as in... in love with an inanimate, edible object.  Utter shame ensued when the expectations were not met.\n*  Fried pickles\nWho cuts up their pickles and then fries them?  Did you use 9,000 lbs. of salt?  Dear lord... make.the.pain.stop.\n* Corn bread\nBlasphemers!  Blasphemers!  You ruined cornbread.  I've imagined cardboard boxes that tasted better and were less dry.  \n\nYour concept is interesting.  Your patio is superb (except when it is 100 degrees out...).  Your service is poop.  Your food is average.\n\nSo, 3 stars.",2012-07-04,15:33:24

I generally enjoy Korean food, but I have only had the food that my Korean friend and his family make.  I've never been to a Korean restaurant before.  Thus, maybe my review is skewed or not a proper baseline.\n\nThat said, the service was not terribly good as has been mentioned in numerous reviews.  And, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to forgive someone for having horrible service just because ""Asian places having service that sucks"" as an over-generalization.  The service was terrible, absolutely terrible.\n\nThe kimchi tasted just like my friend's mother makes it... freaking good.  The steamed and the fried dumplings (we ordered both at $6.95 each) were pretty good.  I ate from the steamed side mostly, but that's just because I tend to avoid fried foods for health purposes...  yeah, I'm weird.  Deal with it. :)\n\nThe BBQ on your table was interesting.  I thought that it was neat that the smoked wood was actually at our table and the food was cooked there.  I disliked the fact that you had to order two meats to have BBQ at your table, though.  What if you came in as a single and wanted to have the experience?  Seems kinda crummy that you'd have to order more food than you'd eat in a sitting just because that's their requirement.  I don't see how the profit margins could be such that I'd be required to order two meats when the cheapest one is $16.95.  I'm sorry, but a half pound of chicken + labor + overhead doesn't cost you $16.95.  I should be able to order one.\n\nPricing aside, the BBQ sirloin, BBQ chicken, and BBQ short ribs were all decent but not crispy due to uneven heat from the coals.  Moreover, the server definitely wanted us to eat less-than-completely cooked chicken.  I suggest you be the judge not your server.  Anyhow, I'd rather take trips deep into Antioch for something better.\n\nOverall, if you don't live in Antioch or Nolensville, then I don't really see a reason to journey out to Seoul Garden.

It's serve (like lunchroom style) and seat yourself in style.  So, you grab your tray and silver, walk up to the counter, and order either your meat and two or meat and three.  You walk a couple more feet and pay at the register.  It's a pretty simplistic concept and works for most Meat and Threes including this one.\n\nThe day I was there the vegetable choices were:  green beans (in some sopping wet liquid that looked like water), green bean casserole, mac'n'cheese, sweet potatoes (but let it be noted I had to ask what they were...), fried okra, and some other kind of casserole.  The meat choices were coconut fried chicken breasts (thin sliced breasts or pounded, not sure which), meat loaf, and something else (I didn't ask).\n\nMy choices:  Mac'n'cheese, coconut chicken, fried okra.

The full slab of ribs was ""fall off the bone"" cooked which, according to BBQ judges, is ""backyard stuff"".

It was probably my fault for not pulling the door shut hard enough.\n\n* Related: The room had a balcony with a sliding glass door... which had one of those metal security bars across it. Kinda shabby to start with. But seeing how the frame of the glass door was actually cracking the pain and pulling away... not cool. Hearing the wind rattle the glass door: Not cool.\n\n* Further related: I could hear everything from the guy and his ""escort""/special friend from the room next door.

The hotel has tried some neat tricks to accommodate these; they had a device on the nightstand that functioned like a power strip, with four outlets and two USB charging slots. Way cool.

On the power strip was the device, the lamp, the alarm clock and another lamp.

First time I've gone to the bar to get a drink and there was no one else waiting, just 2 people sitting at the bar, already served.\n\nThe bartender upon our arrival says she'll be right back - given we were ordering a sauv blanc and an iced tea, could have easily given our order prior to her departure.  She then left for over 10 minutes (during which time a manager or some other employee came behind the bar but made no acknowledgement of us, or attempted to take our order)...and then upon return, did not apologize, but asked if we've decided what we want...well, i decided prior to you leaving, and i sure as hell hope within 10 minutes I'd have decided on one drink!\n\nShe then took the other people who had accumulated's orders prior to serving our solitary glass of wine and one iced tea...and she asked if it was for here or to go, after taking out the glass. I said ""for the balcony,"" (AKA NOT TO GO), and she switched it out with a plastic cup. Given $9.50 for a house sauv is greater than nyc and London pricing (and the cocktails are actually less in most cases), I would say that it could warrant an actual glass, to remain on venue - which we mentioned..and she stated that they were short of glasses given it's ""saint pattys""...well, I'm sure you have a dishwashing machine. Regardless, she at no point said thank you, and was quite rude throughout, enough so that I truly regret my frequent visits, and one of us complained (about the cup, not the delay and rudeness) to management (however, had I complained, the rudeness would have been my primary issue, not the cup).\n\nTo note, the balcony was 100% empty - for the first time I've ever seen, so no, they were not busy, also evidenced by the lack of patrons at the bar.  Even at the point we left, there were only 2 more couples, whose orders she took prior to serving us, so not exactly a complete rush for which she would be stressed...nor did she go tot the restroom, so not sure where she went for 10+ minutes.  \n\nHaving been a server, and having brought many, many groups here over the years, and visiting multiple times every visit to nola, I found this pretty disappointing.  \n\nThat said, I'll still return, if only for a drink on the balcony, and hope there is a different bartender.",2015-03-18,23:23:27

However, after we left the manager called us to inquire what had happened, since another table had seen the commotion and pointed it out to the manager.  He was incredibly apologetic and told us that she was trying to hide this experience from him, and that he had not even been told we wanted to speak with a manager.  As my friends were returning to NY the next day and we had brunch plans already, we couldn't come back to compensate for the experience, so he said he would call us back the next day to figure out how to remedy the situation.  Thus far this has not happened, hence the 2 stars, but regardless of if it is remedied, the waitress's behavior was absurdly inappropriate, coming from someone who has waitressed.

And frankly, no wonder it was never recommended to us since the food here is nothing to write home about. I am a big fan of risotto, and often cook it at home. For a change, I wanted to try a restaurant quality risotto, so ordered risotto in a creamy mushroom sauce while my husband went for sole fillet with spinach and white wine sauce. I am not lying when I say that even though the place was almost completely empty, we had to wait for our food for good 40 minutes. I almost died of hunger. And drinking wine definitely did not help. When our food arrived I was astonished to find out that my risotto was cold in the middle. I never return the food because doing so makes me feel bad, so I just eat and quietly complain. My husband was not ecstatic about his sole either because it was somewhat undercooked and excessively salty. I wish we had the courage to tell the waitress that what we ordered did not come out right.

Hey, I am a young idealist who likes burgers! I can get behind that, right?\n\nThis location is very new, shiny and clean. Their system is you order, they bring it to your table. The staff was super friendly, they were checking up on customers after they had received their food, making sure everything was to their liking. \n\nSo, on to the food. I got a cheeseburger, which has a single patty (the elevation burger has two) with cheddar, elevation sauce (like ""special sauce""), lettuce, tomato, pickles, and grilled onions. Chad and I split some fries, too. They also offer two kinds of veggie burgers and grilled cheese for the vegetarians. \n\nBurgers come in those cute little paper pockets, making for some easy eating. The meat itself was a bit disappointing, it was pretty dried out. Fast food burgers are usually overcooked/well done, but I think these could benefit from either a bit more fat or less cooking. I can definitely taste the difference between a regular steak and a organic, grass-fed, free-range steak, but the meat on these burgers do not taste any better than other fast food burgers. I'm not sure if it was because of the toppings or how it was processed. However, the rest of the burger was great, which sounds weird since I just said the patty kind of sucked. But the cheese was, like, real cheese. And the bun was really good, a little eggy, like a light brioche. The veggies were really fresh and the onions were sweet. The whole thing could have used way more sauce, though. \n\nThe fries were not as good as Five Guys, but they were definitely not bad. If you like shoestring style, you'll love these. They cook their fries in olive oil and you can taste the difference if you don't douse them in ketchup. They were a bit like McDonald's, cooked to the same color and well-salted. But they were still quite tasty and did not need any additional condiments. \n\nThe milkshakes looked good, they're made with Blue Bunny.

The rice is NOT vegetarian - they cook it with chicken broth.  The refried beans are vegetarian.  The tortillas are lard-free.  I am pretty confident they slather their vegetables in BUTTER, despite the fact that the two times I've ordered the Fajitas - I asked them to kindly use vegetable oil instead.

We ordered the wings again and were happy to have a drumette to wingette ratio of 1 to 1 (6 of each).  That's how it should be, not 1 to 11.  We got the hot oriental wings, which really loved.  They're rated a 4 out of 5 on their hot scale.  They don't start off very hot, but it's a lingering heat, so my wife only ate 3 or 4.  Glad the waitress notified us that the Dragon Wings, a 5 out of 5, may be too spicy.  Good save.  \n\nThe veggie salad we split was decent.  Good size with assorted peppers in it.  The dressing was raspberry vinaigrette, which tasted fine, but appeared pretty gelatinous as we poured it over the salad.  A house dressing may be a better option.\n\nFor our dinner we split a calzone, which was plenty for two after sharing the two appetizers.  We added in sausage, bacon, broccoli, spinach, and garlic and it was delicious.  Toppings (or in this case fillings) in every bite.  The marinara can sometimes make or break the calzone, but this marinara definitely added to the meal and it was provided in a bowl, not little cups like some try and give you.  Definitely recommend trying one, and I will say our combination of ingredients worked great together if you're interested.\n\nThe beer list is also a high point here.  It is extensive to say the list.  I'm not a beer connoisseur by any means, but it seemed like they had a good range and there should absolutely be something for everyone.  Prices were great with the most expensive I saw being $5.75 or $6, while majority were in the $3-$5 range.  I'm new to the area, but in the few popular spots I've been to thus far, these prices are way better.  They also sell 6-packs in store and again have a solid selection.  I can definitely see myself picking up a few from here in the near future.  And speaking of drinking, if you've had too much and live within 3 miles, they have a shuttle bus to get you home.  This is new I believe and I don't know when it actually operates, but if it's going to be one of those nights, I would inquire early on.  Cool idea either way.  I live about 2.5 miles, so I may put it to use.\n\nMy only draw back from the evening would be the cleanliness outside on the patio.  Yes it rained earlier in the day (like 5-6 hours earlier) but if you're serving drinks at the bar outside, you should at least wipe down the chairs and clean up after previous groups.  I'll admit we were only out there for 15-20 minutes, but multiple tables had overflowing ash trays, which doesn't appetize anyone, and empty bottles piling up.  Just clear that stuff off so more people can enjoy the area because the wait times to tend to get pretty long here.  We were told an hour and only had to wait 20 minutes though.\n\nThe outdoor patio and my previous experience don't allow me to rate Pizza Pub a 4-star just yet, but they're getting close.

The order was a large supreme pizza and a dozen spicy garlic wings. Pizza was average to below average at best. Same usual issues I have with PA pizzas: too doughy and too heavy/dense.

The bad memories of that evening mixed with the clowns was enough to drive me away from this place for a good 10 years.\n\nBut then a name change and a revamp (plus a long wait at McCloskey's) gave us the opportunity to give it a try.  We went in through the bar and then walked into the restaurant.  As far as I could tell, there was not a specific place for a hostess, so we walked back into the bar with a lost look on our faces and finally someone asked if we needed a seat.  We were sat 10 feet from the bar, which was perfect since the NCAA Final Four was on TV.\n\nThe beer list is solid and the prices were not that bad - not that they list them, but I can say after we got the bill, I was actually shocked at how reasonable they were.  \n\nTo start, we shared a plate of calamari.

In fact, it still kind of terrifies me.  What the heck did we eat? I am not saying it was bad (they weren't amazing either and definitely frozen, not fresh).  I even polled some people throughout the weekend to see if they ever experienced something like this - they hadn't.  I am still confused and slightly concerned.\n\nFor the rest of the meal, I had the chicken sandwich with apricot and brie and the fella had a chicken quesadilla.  The quesadilla was lacking in flavor and was kind of cold.  The chicken sandwich was good - but you really have to like brie to order it.  The fries were also cold.

We tried to flag the waitress down 3 different times to get another beer and she would walk the other way each time.  I mentioned we were 10 feet from the bar, right?  She would even go to the table behind us and ask how they were doing and then walk away again.  The bartender came out and occasionally helped us too.  He was nice.  Also, there was another waitress that was clearly off the clock since she was drinking at the bar, but helped us with the check too.  \n\nThe bar area has been improved, but it still looks like your friend's basement from 1972.

Two Asians walk into N'awlins... and how does that joke finish? Oh wait, it wasn't a joke because it happened in real life. I'll tell you how it went down. A handful of other parties were served before us, so not only did we wait a long time to put our orders in, but it also took forever and a day for us to get our food! By the time we finished our food and paid, the market was literally closing and daylight was gone. \n\nFOOD- It was ok. Definitely a bit on the oiler side, especially the fries. I ordered the gator burger because they ran out of gator dogs (womp). I finished it all, but I think the variety of hot sauces available made it more exciting and yummy than it would have been plain.

The food has always been reliable, but now that I am an adult, I find it lacking excitement. The service is always impeccable and I have never been disappointed by the overall decor or ambience.

My wife and I recently joined a group of perhaps 30 Yelpers for dinner at Cafe de Manila, providing a great opportunity to try a variety of flavors. Although it took a while to get the first orders out, the friendly staff did a pretty good job under the circumstances.\n\nFirst up, Lumpia ($7.95), thin and crispy pork egg rolls served with a spicy-sweet chili sauce. I've enjoyed lumpia many times, and these did not disappoint. Following was Tokwa't Baboy ($9.95), bite-sized pork belly and tofu chunks stacked together and deep-fried, served with a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. If you love both bacon and Asian food, you'll want this for breakfast. And lunch. And, well, you get the idea.\n\nNext was something I just couldn't abide, Mangga at Bagoong ($5.95), a paste of mashed mango and salted, fermented shrimp. No, no, no. Even the smell was bad enough that I had to move that bowl to an adjacent, empty table. An acquired taste, I presume.\n\nThankfully, the next item was Laing ($7.95), a delicious mess of shredded taro leaves cooked with coconut milk and ginger, akin to Indian Saag. The leaves were a little tougher than most cooked greens, but the dish was one I'd order again. Even better was Chicken Adobo ($8.95), featuring chunks of chicken cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaf, garlic, and whole peppercorns. My wife and I probably enjoyed this stew the best of all items sampled.\n\nThe menu described Pork Menudo ($8.95) as pork meat stew with liver cubes, chickpeas, potatoes, and tomato sauce. My wife took the leftovers for lunch and reported, ""This was similar in flavor to the adobo, though I couldn't detect any liver. Under bright office lighting I realized the meat was actually chunks of hot dog, and there were raisins as well. Very different from the description."" Maybe they weren't prepared for our large group and had to improvise.\n\nPancit (noodle) dishes are a mainstay and Pancit Palabok ($7.95) sounded amazing, with rice noodles, prawn, smoked fish flake, shrimp, sliced hard-boiled egg, crunchy chicharon, and orange sauce. Yet, I couldn't detect much--if any--shrimp or prawn, though there was plenty of fish flake, egg, chicharon (fried pork rind) and orange sauce. Not something I'd want every day (or week), but good enough I'd like to try it from a different restaurant for comparison.\n\nKare Kare ($10.95), a stew of oxtail with mixed vegetables cooked in peanut sauce is something I've had better tastes of in the past. The texture of the veggies was odd, and the peanut sauce seemed ""off"". Not terrible, but just not as good as I know it can be. Last of the entrees, Dinuguan ($8.95), the pork meat stew basted in pork blood and serrano chiles colloquially known as ""Chocolate Meat"". My wife found this to be ""tasty, but rich. A few bites is enough, more would be too much."" To my eyes it looked like chunky, dark chocolate pudding (hence the nickname), with a livery smell. Folks who like organ meats enjoyed it, but I can't say I'm a fan.\n\nFinally dessert, beginning with Ube Halaya ($4.99), a cake of mashed ube root (purple yam) cooked with brown sugar, and condensed/evaporated milks. My wife and I agreed it's a pretty shade of purple, but it looks like Play-Doh® and doesn't taste much better. However, the Leche Flan ($4.99) was really outstanding. As with the Mexican variety, this custard is made of egg yolks and milk topped with caramel syrup, but we found Cafe de Manila's rendition to be superior in both flavor and texture. A perfect end to this gastronomic adventure.",2014-06-19,00:37:37

The menu combines pub and comfort food staples with creative housemade and ""foodie"" ingredients. There are a variety of salads, sandwiches, and dinner entrees ranging in price from $8 to $30, but our foursome chose items from the ""Snacks"" menu to share amongst the table.\n\nOf course, one can't visit a brewery and distillery without ordering tasting flights of beer ($8) and spirits ($12). Favorites among beers sampled include a cocoa milk stout and very nice saison, though all were pretty decent. Less successful were the spirits. I try to give craft distillers extra leeway, but the vodka had an unpleasant, sugary flavor and the gin was pretty harsh on the back end. Best was an award-winning silver corn whiskey, good enough to indicate there's a chance for improvement on its cousins.\n\nFour complimentary cornbread fritters were served in a small, antique-style saucepan with a copper handle ($7 if ordered from menu). Little pillows of jalapeño and garlic cornbread were lighted drizzled in a honey and housemade bourbon glaze. Not too spicy, not too sweet; a great beginning to our nosh. \n\nNext up, a small jar stuffed with house-pickled green beans ($4). Sweet and crisp with a touch of garlic, these were a surprise hit around the table. The green stuff was followed by an order of poutine ($8.50), a decent pile of fries covered in oxtail gravy and cheese curds. The gravy was pretty tasty--reminiscent of grandma's pot roast--but the dish was a bit sparse on the curd front. Definitely less cheese than traditional poutine, not nearly enough to go with the amount of fries served.\n\nJoining the growing number of dishes on our table, pork belly tacos (4 for $14) described as ""street tacos"" made with pickled slaw, cilantro, cotija cheese, and lime crema. Although possibly the most expensive street taco I've had, the flavor combination was quite good. Even better, an order of duck confit sliders (3 for $14) served with pickled carrot slaw and sriracha aioli on a grilled, locally-baked bun. Spicy, sweet, and delicious.\n\nFor $8 we received a small pot of macaroni and a blend of four cheeses, topped with house bacon bits. Literally a pint-sized serving, we each had a spoonful of what turned out to be a mediocre experience. A good cheese sauce should be smooth; the gritty texture of this batch indicates either impatience or inattention while building the sauce. It's the sort of kitchen error we home cooks can commiserate with, but I'd expect better at this price.\n\nAlso $8 and served in the same size pot, brussels sprouts flash-fried with bacon, maple, and sherry vinaigrette were so good even the sprout-hater at the table had three bites. The sprouts were just-tender with just enough bite, and the flavor was tremendous. Totally worth every penny.\n\nWe ordered chicken wings because I was curious about the house barbecue sauce, and the menu indicates a three-pound order for $12 (an outstanding deal if true). What we received was a plate of perhaps 12-14 medium-size wings cooked just right, coated in a sweet sauce that made me wish there was more spice to it. The house ranch dipping sauce was a bit bland, yet with a hint of good buttermilk acidity. Though priced average to market and not a bad deal, the only way this was three pounds is if you included the plate.\n\nThe ladies ended the evening by sharing a beet salad ($10), featuring chunks of cooked red and golden beetroot, arugula, orange segments, goat cheese, walnuts, and sherry vinaigrette. They were both really pleased with the dish, and the serving was ample. In general we had a pretty enjoyable evening, and all things considered I'd say The Depot is on the right track.",2015-12-10,05:51:52

If only the service matched the scenery. We were the only table ordering food--including two very simple salads--yet it took close to an hour for our appetizer to appear and fully 90 minutes before the six-item order was complete.\n\nWe started on chicken wings from a choice of seven flavors, ordering half ""Gotti style"" and half hot ($9.49, 8 pieces). The wings were an average size and very crispy without being overcooked. The hot sauce was anything but, tasting mostly very sweet with a hint of spice. Gotti style was a rub of powdered garlic and parmesan that wasn't bad, just a bit dry.\n\nI wanted to taste the chili so I asked if they could do a cup rather than full bowl. Being bereft of cups, a bowl was filled half-way, topped with shredded cheese, onion, and a dollop of sour cream ($4.49). The mixture was basic hamburger chili with beans, but like the hot wing sauce it was sweet rather than spicy, akin to marinara. It reminded me of the chili served by a certain eponymous chain restaurant, bland and sweet. Adding insult, it was served just above room temperature.\n\nSandwiches and salads all have fighting terms for names. The Over Hand Right burger was--according to the menu--a 1/3lb patty with cheddar and American cheese, mayo, onion, lettuce, tomato, served on a tiny bun with a side of steak fries ($9.99). I was asked how I'd like it cooked--medium rare--and received it well done, much like the burgers your uncle overcooks in the backyard. Frankly, this was the smallest $10 burger I've ever seen, thrown together in a way that required reassembly before taking a bite. The handful of fries were fine.\n\nMy wife's Footwork salad involved grilled skirt steak, baby spinach, iceberg lettuce, tomato, red onion, shredded cheese and crumbled blue cheese ($10.49). The meat was tender-yet-underseasoned, and there wasn't much of it. The plate was mostly a sea of iceberg with an odd grouping of spinach on the sides, and a bit of cheese and veggies. You can have any dressing you like so long as it's ranch.\n\nAfter the wait for food it was almost amusing that they choked on a D'arce Choke salad, apparently not added to the ticket even though I'd asked a couple questions of the server on that item  ($9.49). Though ordered with grilled chicken, my pile of iceberg was covered with a ton of very dry, deep-fried breast meat that was difficult to eat. Apparently they were trying to compensate for delivering it half an hour late, but giving me twice as much of a bad thing doesn't make it good.\n\nThough only found on the specials board, I'd been told I have to try the pizza ($9.99, 12"" w/3 toppings). Though easily the most successful item ordered, it was adequate if not award-winning. The 'za was topped with plenty of cheese, mushroom, black olive, and sausage, and though the crust didn't have a lot of flavor it was definitely housemade and hand-formed. It wasn't completely crispy, but the edges had nice chew. The sauce tasted much like the chili--bland and sweet--but luckily there wasn't much on the pie. Extra points for using a puree with tomato chunks instead of canned sauce. For the money I wouldn't mind another bite of that pizza, but I'll phone it in an hour ahead and take it home.",2016-07-22,05:11:07

That is one expensive Blue Collar Boilermaker. Didn't attempt bowling as the price is 2-3 times higher than anything else in town. Giant screen TV's at the end of the lanes are a huge distraction to a bowler's concentration and do nothing to enhance the experience.\n\nThe bar bites are surprisingly good.

When the only completely flawless thing about our meal was an above-average salsa bar, it's safe to say there's some room for improvement.\n\nAt bare minimum, a plate of nachos should involve corn tortilla chips and some kind of melted cheese. Although our order of super nachos did begin with a plate of chips, it was a bit lacking in the cheese department ($8). The chips were slathered in sour cream, topped with a good amount of diced carne asada and about half as much refried beans and guacamole. Finally, a half cup of shredded, unmelted cheddar and monterey jack topped the pile; the whole thing was room temp at best and generally a disappointment. \n\nAn a la carte order of enchiladas included two six inch tubes of corn tortilla stuffed with shredded chicken, covered in mild red sauce, a sprinkle of cheese, and quite a bit of shredded iceberg lettuce ($4.85). The flavors were very mild by themselves; salsa bar to the rescue.\n\nThe best thing about the two combination plates ordered--carnitas ($8.35) and chile verde ($6.75)--was the refried beans' noticeable touch of cumin and other seasonings. Less successful were the meats on both plates. The shredded pork was quite dry and underseasoned, while the diced pork in green sauce was tough and very salty. The carnitas improved with the addition of salsa, but there was nothing to be done with the salty verde except mix it with rice and beans, chased with plenty of water. \n\nA pair of burritos fared better. The burrito adobada involved a large, fresh flour tortilla stuffed with fresh, chunky guacamole, pico de gallo, and at least a pound of diced pork marinated in a vinegar-based red sauce ($5.20). The addition of housemade, spicy salsa turned this into the best item I tasted. Nearly as tasty, my friend's super burrito--though a little salty--included a good balance of carne asada, refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, cheese, and lettuce ($6).\n\nMachaca is a style of dried-then-reconstituted meat--usually beef--that sounds a bit odd to the uninitiated, yet can be delicious when done right. Though perhaps a bit chewier than other examples, the meat in a our machaca torta was nicely seasoned and worked quite well with the pepper, onion, egg, lettuce, and guacamole on the sandwich ($4.20). The telera roll was soft and inviting, which made the fact it was incompletely sliced a bit of a bummer. If I'd been served that at the drive-thru it could have led to a messy disaster. The bread was stronger than it looked--resistant to tearing--and required application of a knife to separate the halves. On both flavor and texture, this was definitely the second-best item we tried.\n\nAs for that salsa bar, I've seen some with more variety but none that beat it on flavor. There seems to be a phenomenon at many taquerias where I'll find one or two good sauces, then at least one I never want to taste again. This unassuming salsa bar is one of the few that truly has something for everyone, without any sour notes. From some very mild salsas and medium hot garnishes, on through to a spicy/smooth guacamole and a very spicy, roasted salsa with its mix of flavors dancing in the heat, they really should consider bottling and selling a couple of those to take home.\n\nThough an imperfect meal it wasn't without its charms. A little restraint with the salt shaker--with as much attention given to nachos as with the salsa--and Alderto's could lure me back for another taste.",2016-03-25,00:12:07

AVOID.\n\nSeriously, I can't figure out how they stay in business. The food itself is on the very low end of cheap, strip-mall fast food Chinese fare available in town, and the only reasons you might choose this joint are: (a) you're drunk, (b) you're broke, (c) you have no taste-buds or self-respect.\n\nYou're also going to need a high tolerance for a complete lack of service, bordering on abuse. Don't bother trying to call in an order, it's nearly impossible to communicate with the proprietor when you're standing right in front of her. She's rude, she shouts at the customers and the staff, and is generally an unpleasant person to be around. \n\nMy suggestion is to take your five bucks next door to the supermarket and buy some ramen noodles.

Sadly, our experience was a bit like having seen a movie trailer that is far better than the actual flick.\n\nService was friendly, and the coffee was good though less than hot. Apologies were made for the kitchen prepping a catering gig. The tepid coffee was harbinger to an hour-long wait for room temperature food. A Belgian waffle with fresh fruit and whipped cream was ordered with toasted coconut on the side ($7), arriving completely undercooked, with a smattering of fruit, cream, and the coconut tossed on top. I've had oatmeal that was crispier.\n\nThe Foghorn Leghorn waffle fared better ($12), chicken breast and bacon ironed into scratch-made waffle batter. It was actually crispy, served as four triangles with buffalo ranch dressing and maple syrup on the side. We added a side of country gravy for an extra $2 and an over-medium egg for another $1.50. The egg was fine, and the gravy was actually warm and loaded with sausage. However, the chicken was pounded flat and very dry.\n\nA pair of omelets were ordered with bacon, spinach, scallion, tri-color pepper, mushroom, monterey jack cheese, and sliced avocado on top ($8), one with sourdough and the other wheat toast. Neither bread was remotely toasted. One omelet was nicely folded--though bland--and the sauteed ingredients were quite good. The other was a lopsided scramble, with fillings in a little centered pocket. You'd never guess they came from the same kitchen.\n\nA Rabbit's Dream salad ($9) involved romaine and red leaf lettuce, spinach, bell pepper, radish, cucumber, cherry tomato, carrot, artichoke heart, black olive, and house ranch dressing. It did indeed have all those ingredients, though in a serving size I would call an overdressed ""side salad"". Perfect for a rabbit with modest aspirations.\n\nThe large flour tortilla of Da'Shroominator wrap ($9) included a chef's mix of sauteed mushrooms with chipotle spice, jalapeno, pepper jack cheese, scallion, avocado, and cilantro cream, with the addition of tri-tip for another $5 and pretzel bites on the side. The bites were warm and sprinkled with shredded parmesan. The filling was quite tasty, though spartan in presence. We had to hunt for a lone, thin-sliced bit of tri-tip, re-grilled to the point of jerky. The tortilla was heavily folded in on itself--a tortilla wrap stuffed with tortilla-- lightly seasoned with goodies. The sauce was drizzled on top; a messy way to serve handheld food. We picked at the good bits and left behind the excess carb.\n\nFinally, His Mistress' grilled cheese ($11), garden herb toast with melted havarti, monterey jack, and parmesan, supposedly topped with balsamic roasted Brussels sprout and thin-sliced tomato. I may have missed the vegetation while being underwhelmed by the smallest $11 sandwich I've ever seen, served absolutely stone cold. The chef must really have it in for his ""mistress"". The side of creamed cucumbers was dramatically larger than the sandwich, a cereal bowl of sliced cukes swimming in dairy with plenty of dill weed, and not half bad. But no substitute for the melted, gooey cheese love I'd hoped for.\n\nThe menu sounds great, and they've only been open a few weeks. Perhaps given time they'll learn how to deliver on its promise and decide whether they're a caterer, or a restaurant. They don't seem capable of being both.",2018-10-29,02:05:08

The new menu includes a mix of German-themed items along with American appetizers, sandwiches, and salads. The beers are brewed in-house and definitely reflect the German theme, with Bavarian Hefeweizen, Cologne Kölsch, Munich Dunkel, Dusseldorf Altbier, and Bohemian Pilsner. I availed myself of a couple $3 happy hour pints of hefeweizen and kölsch, a completely enjoyable contrast of styles.\n\n$5 happy hour specials arrived to the table almost as quickly as the drinks, with a plate of 8 mozzarella sticks with marinara, and 6 hot wings with celery, ranch dressing, and herbed shoestring fries. The cheese bites were your basic frozen fare, though the marinara was pleasantly low on sweetness with a nice garlic kick. The wings were pretty big, spicy, and well sauced, though oddly salty. The fries were also well salted, though both wings and fries were nice and crisp. A friend's giant Bavarian soft pretzel ($8.95) was served with spicy mustard, curry ketchup, and beer cheese sauce. They serve this hanging on a sort of display rack, and at 10 ounces it's a pretty impressive serving of bread and dippers.\n\nSpätzle--depending on the regional style--is something between a noodle and a dumpling, and like pasta is served with any number of sauces, meats, veggies, or none at all. This variety was about the size of large elbow macaroni, and likewise heavily doused in beer cheese sauce. One friend's order of spätzle with grilled bratwurst ($10.50) was essentially a big plate of mac n' cheese topped with chopped bacon and a sliced sausage. Another ordered currywurst ($10.50)--a Berlin street food favorite--wherein the bratwurst is sliced up and topped with curried ketchup and a sprinkling of curry powder, paired with a side of the cheesy action. Not my favorite, but she said it reminded her of her visit to Deutschland.\n\nFor me, the best German dish was a plate of pork schnitzel with sides of mushroom gravy and spaetzle ($10.50). Schnitzel is actually of Austrian origin, but has inspired any number of variants including Italian cotoletta, South American/Mexican milanesa, and American country fried steak. The gravy was dark and rich, but the seasoning on the meat was--again--pretty salty. Someone in this kitchen really likes spiking the ol' blood pressure, although the fair amount of black pepper did help. I liked it, but it could be better.\n\nA chopped chef salad with blue cheese dressing ($10.95) was perhaps the only time I've seen something called a chef salad served tossed, with the deli meats and dressing mixed in. The blend of lettuce greens, turkey, roast beef, ham, red onion, and halved cherry tomato was a bit heavy on the onion, and the dressing barely had any sense of blue cheese. Notably absent was hard boiled egg, so maybe this would be better termed a deli salad.\n\nFinally, the ""Awful Awful"" burger, done in the style of the Little Nugget's favorite and served atop a basket containing a full pound of fries ($10.50). The half pound of ground chuck was done medium rare, served on an onion bun with American cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomato, and purple onion; I added thick, crispy bacon for an extra $2.50. It was good. Really good, though I had to send most of the fries home for a friend's hungry youngster to enjoy.",2018-05-07,02:27:33

Thus, the family and I headed to the hinterlands of northern Sparks for an evening meal.\n\nAn appetizer of beer battered pickles was a bit of a surprise ($7.95), as dill pickle spears were used in lieu of the more common sliced pickle ""chips"". The batter was quite good--crispy, not oily--but it's wise to wait a bit before biting in. That was one nuclear hot cucumber. A basket of chicken strips with fries ($9.95) was the grandkid's choice, and the breaded tenderloins were about average. The fries were slightly battered, very crispy, and well seasoned. The strips were best with ranch dressing, but the fries didn't need it.\n\nMy daughter's plate of nachos ($8.95, plus $2 for chicken and $3.50 for a side of guacamole) was the usual pile of tortilla chips cemented together by jack and cheddar cheeses, topped with grilled chicken, refried black beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, and salsa. I'm not really a fan, because it's near impossible to pull these apart and get a decent mix on each chip. She seemed perfectly happy with it. The guac had a fair amount of lime and cilantro and tasted very fresh.\n\nThe boy's mom chose a pulled pork sandwich with fries ($9.95), a pretty heaping amount of pig on a soft French roll, topped with BBQ sauce and sweet coleslaw. The meat itself was fine, but the sauce was mostly sweet without a lot of tang or spice. The slaw wasn't nearly as sweet, and added some welcome texture. I think she enjoyed the fries best of all.\n\nHer husband's buffalo chicken sandwich with onion rings ($9.99) looked impressive. A whole chicken breast on a grilled, sesame seed bun was breaded and crispy--drenched in spicy Buffalo sauce--topped with melted pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and roughly half a sliced avocado. The spice level was nice and warm, but overall oddly salty. Like, very salty. Thankfully, all the fresh ingredients helped tame that down a bit. The battered onion rings were just as good as the fries.\n\nMy breakfast-loving younger daughter chose a blueberry pancake combo ($11.45) with two large, fluffy, blueberry loaded pancakes served with a pair of eggs, choice of meat, and hashbrowns. The menu noted a blueberry compote topping, but that was absent and frankly unnecessary. Her over-medium eggs were perfect, though the bacon was more than a bit on the dark side. The potatoes were just crispy enough to be called ""brown"".\n\nI figured I'd give the chicken fried steak dinner a try ($11.95), and it wasn't bad. The sauteed mix of broccoli/carrot/zucchini was OK, the whipped spuds acceptable, and the sausage gravy had enough flavor to do the job. The meat itself gave fairly easily to a fork and was pounded quite thin, akin to schnitzel or milanesa. Perhaps not the ultimate example, but I'd happily order it again. \n\nService was outstanding; I can't recall when we've ordered and received food that fast. Beverage refills were on the bounce, despite a packed house. There's room for improvement, but we left full and happy.",2019-03-25,06:07:37

The original owners opened it under the name ""Taj Mahal"" in the industrial area on Glendale.  They moved it to the space on S. Virginia now occupied by Thai Chili (next to the XXX theater). \n\nSome time later, new owners took over, changed the name to S.S. Super, and the quality of the food took a decided downturn.  This short-lived period ended when the longest-running owners bought the place, kept the name, and dramatically changed the food quality for the better, as well as installing an excellent lunch buffet.\n\nA few years later, that third set of owners moved to the current location on Moana, changed the name to ""Taste of India"", and continued to provide excellent food & service.  The ambiance consisted of gaudy-yet-fun Indian wall hangings and Indian pop music on the house stereo.  The owner/hostess always greeted you as though you were a long lost relative, i.e., ""How are you my dear? So good to see you again.""  My wife and I LOVED that restaurant, and although we tested out the other Indian offerings in town, we always came back to Taste of India.\n\nRecently we went for lunch at our old favorite, only to find that it has changed hands yet again, along with a name change to ""Taste of Kabob & Curry"".  I'm not sure, but perhaps the owners are the same that operate ""India Kabob & Curry"" near downtown on S. Virginia.  Regardless, things have changed at our old favorite spot.  Gone are the decorations (there is nothing on the walls, and certainly nothing that distinguishes the place from any other strip-mall business), gone is the exceptionally good service, and gone is the outstanding food.\n\nTo be fair, the food wasn't bad.  It may not be fair to compare it against what used to be served in the same location, but honestly, the food's just not on par with that provided by the previous tenants.  Perhaps they'll get better as they find their stride.  Or perhaps it's a regional thing (Punjabi vs. Kashmiri, etc.).  I'll have to try it again in a month or two and see if things have kicked into a higher gear.\n\nThe best thing I can say about the new owners is they've (wisely) expanded their lunch buffet to run every day, instead of just weekdays.  They've also expanded the number of dishes available, compared to our old friends, which if for nothing else makes this a pretty good value for the money.  There is, however, one change that has GOT to go: the obnoxious TV in the front corner of the restaurant.  \n\nAt least one other Yelper mentioned the TV playing Indian music videos during their visit, which I suppose could be a fun addition to the experience.  During our visit, though, the TV was blaring a Spanish-language confrontational talk show (of the Jerry Springer variety), so we got to listen to people shouting at each other in a language that does not originate on the subcontinent.  Half-way through our meal the viewing content changed to a ""telenovela"" ... not much of an improvement.  I'm guessing the television fare was likely the selection of the staff (gone are the Hindu and Sikh cooks and servers, replaced by folks who speak Spanish and whom one might presume did not learn to make curries and tandoori in their grandmother's kitchen).  \n\nPerhaps other folks like to have a blaring TV playing while they eat.  I DO NOT.  In fact, I often avoid restaurants that feature this distraction, thus, I found this to be a HUGE strike against whether we'll be back for another try.  That, and the very casual ""service"" (water refill, anyone?) dropped a couple stars off this review.\n\nI guess it's time for us to make the rounds and try some other options for Indian food in Reno.",2011-03-13,19:44:46

They make up for this by having very attentive table service; my group and I were never lacking for food or beverages (AYCE Lunch $18.95, Dinner $24.95).\n\nFor starters we sampled gyoza, eggroll, baked mussels, dragon balls--tempura fried jalapeno rings stuffed with shrimp, spicy krab, and cream cheese--miso soup, and cucumber salad. The potstickers and eggroll were crispy, the thin-sliced cucumber was doused in plenty of seasoned rice vinegar and sesame, and the mussels were nicely done with scallion, sriracha, shoyu, ponzu, and kewpie mayo. Unfortunately, the miso was barely warm and very salty, with big slices of raw mushroom floating on top. Least effective, the battered jalapeno rings were raw--the capsaicin heat overwhelmed--and they fell apart when picked up.\n\nThe simplicity of nigiri sushi being my favorite--mostly just rice and fish--I ordered individual bites of octopus, freshwater eel, seared tuna, seared scallop, smoked salmon, fresh salmon, mackerel, yellowtail, snapper, and escolar. All of the fin fish was pretty good, the fish-to-rice ratio was decent, the seared scallop was particularly good, and the mackerel--a strong, oily fish that can turn quickly--was surprisingly mild and fresh tasting. Sadly, the octopus was quite tough, and the ""only one order per person"" unagi slices were dwarfed by the amount of rice.\n\nThe list of specialty nigiri sounded good so I ordered one of each: rooster salmon with lemon, pickled jalapeno, and spicy krab; Kei seared tuna with crystal mix, scallop sauce, sriracha, and teriyaki; upside down shrimp with avocado, scallop, and teriyaki; salmon lover with scallop sauce, pickled jalapeno, salmon skin, and scallion; fireball tuna topped with spicy tuna, fried onion, and teriyaki; and a quail egg shooter with ponzu, sriracha, sesame seed, scallion, and tobiko. Although I appreciated the flavor combinations and creativity, the size of each piece was a bit daunting. Even for my big mouth, each one was nearly too large for a single bite and required manhandling lest they fall apart. Of particular note, the shooter featured a sharply sour punch that was not for the faint of heart.\n\nFrom the hand roll selection, a cooked scallop, tobiko, and scallion Jason roll was very good, but the salmon skin roll could have actually used a bit more rice and less crispy fishiness. A little bit of that goes a long way, and I felt like I was crunching through a forest of fish chips. Just not my jam, I guess.\n\nMy companions ordered a mix of fresh and baked long rolls, but I don't know that any bear further description. The rice ranged from gummy to chewy to wet, and none had any flavor that I'd care to experience again. At least two were just plain gross. Based on the overall quality of the nigiri, I'm willing to assume that there are better rolls on the menu.\n\nWe finished with a shared five piece Miami dessert roll, featuring tempura banana, cream cheese, pecans, mango, drizzled with peach, strawberry, and chocolate sauces then sprinkled with coconut flakes. The sweet stuff was ok, but it suffered a bit from having too much rice. Next time I'll stick with the green tea ice cream.",2017-08-27,20:20:44

Because as I navigate through Philadelphia's ""Mexican"" food offerings, I am becoming way too bitter. Because obviously, I know what REAL Mexican food is. . Xochitl is NOT I repeat NOT authentic Mexican food. I came in here knowing that full well but I of course was trying to keep an open mind. \n\nThe fact that they need to put ""So-Cheet"" on the sign was my first annoyance. I get it, it's not a common name, and in Society Hill lets be real, not many people can pronounce it without that help. My second annoyance was our waiter, a tall thin Buddy Holy hipster. While I looked over the menu I asked if the margarita's were offered only on the rocks or blended as well? ""No we put them in a shaker and blend them before they are served"" Uhhhhh... I think to myself, is this guy f*cking with me?! I guess I have to say ""frozen""?  When our drinks arrive I notice my friends ""Sangria"" has ice in it and one tiiiiiny piece of apple? What in the fame of Jesus Christo is going on here?!?!!?\n\nI look over the menu and think OK so it's ""White people Mexican fusion"" I got itttttt. At least they have the good sense not to put cheddar or American cheese on anything. But come on!!! You are trying way too hard, Xochitl. I ordered the fish tacos and discover that even at $16 friggin dollars they do not come with any sides. Are you kidding me?!?! Dear Lord Baby Jesus!!!!  I can feed an entire family real Mexican food on Mission St. for that. They tasted awful. The fish was soaked in some kind of oil and tasted fishy rather than spiced. I had two bites of one, pushed it aside and instead ate off of everyone Else's plates. \n\nThe carnitas tacos were edible but not note worthy. The star dishes of the night were the build your own guac (still some options like tuna?! which I refused to let my friends add were laughable) and the aroz con manchgo. The ""Mexican STREET corn"" ok Esquites was so so. Thank god for my house ""blended in a shaker"" Margarita or I might have just started a riot in the middle of the downstairs seating area. Yes, did I mention we were seated next to the bathrooms downstairs? I had to be stopped from asking our Hispanic runner if she was sour that she has to serve this crap all day. \n\nSigh. The hostess was friendly, the runner was sweet and our water glasses were filled regularly but our waiter was a joke. He never once asked us how the food was and my friend said that on more than one occasion as he checked on the table of uppity young d-bags next to us, he'd look over and simply walk away. What about the bond between hipsters, com-padre? \n\nI will pay top dollar for good food. I will pay a fortune for good authentic Mexican food at this point.

Apricot lemon pancakes were a bit tart, but the compote sweetened it out. The Swedish pancakes were plain tart. It's a nice experience trying a lingonberry though, since I've never heard of it before. It just wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nThe syrup that is served with the sweet potato pancakes was divine. It's creamy with a tinge of sweet, not cloyingly sweet or anything.\n\nFYI, you can order 2 different kinds of pancakes for one order---they just split it and it costs like $1 more or something.

Needless to say this place won't be it.  The room we had here was in the newer Tuscany Tower.  Despite this fact, and the non-smoking nature of the room, the place still smelled of smoke.  Not as bad as the rest of the facility, mind you, which reeked \, but still pretty bad.  The room itself was garish and ugly.  Not modern looking at all. Really disappointing to be honest.  The bed in the room was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The beds at most Hilton properties blow this away. Really the only good thing about the room was the shower, which was nice. \n\nAdditionally, during our stay some genius decided to test the elevator  at 8 in the morning.  This took them out of operation and forced us to scramble to find another elevator on the far side of the building and then make our way back to where we needed to be. Who does this at this hour? When people are heading for breakfast or out to meetings (if not there for pleasure?!?).  We  had a meeting to go to and this almost caused us to be late. Ridiculous.\n\nParking sucks too - getting from the parking deck to our room was a real pain.  Plus they have a whole floor of the deck blocked off for non-hotel guests (players I guess) and its the floor with the best access to the building. Super annoying. \n\nHow bad was our stay? Well we ended up needing to stay in Reno an extra night, but this place sucked so bad that we packed up all our stuff and moved hotels for the night.  Needless to say we will not be returning.  Highly recommended to avoid at all costs.",2013-12-23,03:58:01

My wife calls down to verify that this place does, in fact, take passport photos before we head down since its on the other side of town. My wife is an Aussie and she unsurprisingly has an accent, which might explain the following conversation, were it not for a key point in her first statement (pay attention--there will be a quiz later). The following conversation ensues: \n\n(My wife) My husband needs to renew his US passport, do you take passport photos?\n(Employee - in angry tone) Yes, but only for American passports. \n(My wife) Ok we will be right down. \n(Employee - still pissy) Fine, but just for American passports. \n\nSheesh. You'd think the fact that my wife asked about a US passport would be a clue, but apparently the accent was too much for this genius to process. Needing the photos, and undaunted, we ventured down to South Reno. We walk in and there is one customer there and a handful of bored looking employees. An employee (clearly the one from the phone) comes up to help. I tell her I am here to get a passport photo. She runs through the ""we only do US passport photos"" schpeel again and I rush her along as that's what I need. She fumbles with the camera, take a photo and then says it will be 2-3 minutes and proceeds to head back behind the counter. \n\nSeemingly bored with me she sends some other poor schmuck out to retrieve the photos. He picks up the camera and sighs. The ""American passport"" woman has taken a giant photo of me, not the two head shots I need for the passport, so we must repeat the process. He gets ready to take another picture and the camera fails. Tries again. Fails. Finally on the third try it works. Three minutes later, I am handed my mugshot--worse than any driver's license photo I've had. Ever. I briefly think of making him retake it, but can't be bothered. I'll spend the next DECADE staring at this sucker. Having to go through the mess again is that bad. But wait, we aren't done. They then ring me up (American passport woman returns to do the honors) and it costs--wait for it--$13.95. Yes a full $14 for two tiny head shots. What a rip off. \n\nIf you need a passport photo, do yourself a favor and go somewhere--anywhere--but here. Ugh.",2010-10-04,06:31:35

No most of those folks seem to be gone replaced by 18/19 year old folks who can't answer any questions. For me, the upside is that many of these newbies are extremely hot women, which is great and all (and I'm sure appeals to the contractor set to some degree) but that still doesn't help when they (and this is both the young guys and women at the store--had the chance to ask several of each a few things in the last few days) stare blankly at me in response to my questions.",2010-08-22,20:40:47

At least I hope so. There was a crowd Saturday night, but no wait when we got there around 7:30. We were seated at the last 2-person table upstairs, directly overlooking the kitchen. So let's just say I got to watch a whole lot of chaos, including an order being returned, orders sitting way too long on the counter, and just general pandemonium.\n\nI don't get the long communal table downstairs. All the different parties were seated with empty chairs between them, so isn't that just a huge waste of space? And if you do sit strangers right next to each other, who wants that? I definitely do not.\n\nService seemed to be hit or miss. Our waitress took forever to take our order and bring out the check, but our food came out pretty quickly. Conversely, the table right behind us came in 10 minutes after us, but they had their desserts and check way before us.\n\nI really liked the smoked onions rings at first, but then the more I ate the less I liked. They have a thick, soft batter on them and the onions are thickly cut. We didn't get appetizer plates when they were brought out, yet the dipping sauce is served in a small jar that you can't fit an onion ring into unless you cut it up. I'm all for the cute little touches in this place (like the jars), but in this case it's not functional.\n\nI also wasn't a fan of the two types of catsup I tried. The normal that comes with the burgers is really sweet. And I got the crazy catsup with my fries and liked that even less. Kudos for making their own sauces, but in this case I prefer Heinz.\n\nHowever, the fries were really good. Salty and hot. I ordered the patty melt, which came on crustless rye instead of the homemade bun. By the time the food was delivered, the bread was soaked through with grease so I had to eat it with a fork. It tasted pretty good, but I couldn't differentiate between the MO grass-fed beef and beef at any other restaurant. It was a little crumbly, too. (I ordered no pink, though) The onions were too thickly sliced for my liking, but the Rooster sauce tasted good. The burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickle slices on the side. The 2 tiny pickle chips I got were so good, but they covered about half my burger. The same is true of the tiny tomato slices. Extra pickles cost extra. Bad.\n\nThey have the largest soda selection of any place I've ever been. Pretty much anything you could possibly want they have. I went with the cola on draft. Good stuff.\n\nSince we were at the very last table, we were closest to the upstairs soda fountain and dirty dishes table (where the servers stack all the dirty dishes). It seemed like the wait staff was a little frazzled and I definitely overheard some complaints coming from them. The dirty dishes were stacked so high I thought they were going to fall over. Apparently no one was coming up to take them to the kitchen. Yet I saw one employee filling water bottles the entire time and another wiping glasses the entire time. I think they just need some better organization here.\n \nFor 2 burgers, 2 sodas, onion rings, and small fries our bill came to $30 + tip. Not too bad.",2011-10-31,18:46:00

The box was soaked through and the crust had absorbed so much grease it was limp. And that's probably the last time I'll get pizza there.\n\nThe wings were ok. They offer hot, bbq, and teryaki (I think). They were very similar to Pizza Hut's wings. The grinder wasn't very good. It was the chicken, bacon, ranch and I could tell the chicken was the precooked, packaged stuff. Not like I expect them to make it fresh there, but still a turn-off.\n\nMy other problem is the restaurant always seems dirty.

I tried the salsiccia and pepper pizza and that was pretty good, too.  Otherwise, the house salad was pretty average.

For whatever reason, I still don't love it here. All the pieces seem to be there, yet it just seems to fall short. I've dined a couple times before a show at Powell and made sure to get there plenty early based on other reviewers bad service experiences. I never had any major issues. Both times our server was friendly and the food came out very quickly. There was a small wait for the bill and once the server forgot to take off our coupon, but other than that it was fine.\n\nI almost always order grilled cheese when it's on the menu, so I made sure to try the Royal Grille - white cheddar and mozzarella with apple slices. I really only have one demand when I order a grilled cheese and that's that the cheese be thoroughly melted and hot when delivered. This one wasn't. The cheese looked like it was melted at one point, but sat in the kitchen too long and hardened up again. I realize it's hard when there are four other entrees, but a grilled cheese is really time sensitive so please get it to the table asap.\n\nThe sandwiches come with a choice of salad or chips and both the St. Louis City salad and Stutz salad are both good. The STL City salad tastes exactly like the Pasta House salad. The Stutz is a little more inventive with goat cheese and an interesting dressing.\n\nThe best thing I've tried on the menu is the Blackhawk. This is something I would never order, but my husband got it and I tried it and it was delicious. The rolls were super soft and the spread of olive oil, basil, garlic, and goat cheese was a perfect complement.\n\nThe Focaccia Florentine was a let down. It's a very small piece of focaccia covered in basically spinach artichoke dip topped with two tomato slices.\n\nOn to dessert. It might be a little unfair to rate dessert since I'm not a huge ice cream person and much prefer cakes, pies, tarts, etc., but oh well. I've only ordered the pineapple inside out cake since it's only one of two items on the menu that isn't all ice cream. It is really good. I love their whipped cream and carmel sauce. Very good.\n\nSo basically the food is OK and I wouldn't go here just for the ice cream.

The woman, who I suspect to be the owner or relative, slowly walked off (without menus). I stayed in the lobby. After 30-45 seconds, I was wondering if I was supposed to follow her....she came back and then picked up menus seated me. \n\nThe table she seated me at was awkwardly blocked by a food cart, which I found to be odd, since I thought she was making sure she had a table ready (even though there were plenty). \n\nThe waiter seemed rushed, annoyed, and in a bad mood... \n\nWhen he asked for our drink order and we told him that we were both okay with water I think he lost interest.. \n\nMy friend ordered the gyro and asked if she could pay more for a salad as her side. He said ""no"". \n\nI ordered the combo, with lamb, mousaka, and dolma. The server asked if I would like a salad with it, which I said ""yes"". \n\nMy lamb was very tasty, but the mousaka and dolma tasted like mushy leftovers, which was very disappointing. \n\nWhen we got the bill, I noticed that I was charged for a salad, which is fine, but peculiar since my friend was unable to order one. \n\nOn the way out, I apologized to my friend for choosing Spiro's...",2011-01-29,22:05:03

I sent our stylist my pinterest page full of Amsale, Jenny Yoo, and Monique Lhullier dresses.  On the phone I was asked for my bridesmaids' shoe & dress sizes.  I was also asked to describe what colors we were interested in, and what styles we definitely did not want to see.  \n\nWhen we showed up for our appointment the bridal suite dressing room was full, so we were ushered to the regular fitting rooms.  No biggie, but it was awkward and cramped.  Turns out Nordstrom didn't have any Amsale dresses we requested, nor did they have the sizes we needed.  When my size 6 wearing friend asked for shoes she was given a pair of black pumps several sizes too big (maybe an 8 or 9).  It was also difficult to view the colorways each dress came in - the sales associate ended up bringing us her ipad to show us the options, but this sort of defeated the purpose of being in-store to see the dresses.\n\nAfter trying about three dresses, it was very clear only one of them might work.  Unfortunately the Jenny Yoo dress we liked takes up to 4 months to order, and our orders would be final sale.  Also a bummer?  They didn't have any dresses or fabric swatches in the color we were interested in.  With so little flexibility we were left with no choice but to leave empty handed.\n\nHonestly, the sales associate tried to be helpful, but my friends and I left wondering why we made the appointment in advance when they didn't have the styles, sizes, or colors we were interested in.",2014-02-25,00:46:06

Yes, please.  House made veggie burger OPTIONS?  Oh yeah!\n\nBased on concept and vegetarian options alone I'd give Bareburger five stars.  My build-your-own black bean burger with pepper jack cheese & tons of veggie extras (jalapenos, crispy chickpea onions, sprouts, greens) was one of the best I've ever had.  \n\nToo bad my husband's meal was laughable.  He ordered one of the suggested combinations -- possibly the el matador -- wrapped in collard greens instead of a bun.  Big mistake!  This burger was teensy tiny (see pic).  He had three bites of meat and one last bite of greens.  We were shocked at the portion size for this nearly $13 burger.\n\nOur server, in this fast-food yet full-service restaurant, was friendly and knew the menu well.  However, he awkwardly coursed out our meal.  Our basket of fries came out as an appetizer and our burgers came out only after we were done with the fries.  Weird.  \n\nOverall, we wouldn't return for dine-in service.  At $35 (with tax and tip) for two people and what I'll call fries with a burger and a half, Philly has too many other unique offerings (for the same price) to justify a return visit.

A good sign that its a  good Vietnamese restaurant is that its always packed solid.  Their Pho is a bit salty and has more taste than Miss Saigon (its better).  But I would say that just about everything else on the menu, though cheaper, is not as good as it is at Miss Saigon.  Their rice paper rolls and bubble tea (powder based) were huge disappointments.  The rolls' pork tasted off and you have to make a special request for the peanut sauce.

I found two designer skirts that I really liked and for only $150.  It was a decent deal.  The main issue that I have with this place is that I came across some articles of clothing with defects, which can be rather disappointing if it would otherwise be perfect for you...  I really don't think they should sell items with problems and I found a few with issues.  I feel that you can find these designer styles at discounts at the new Nordstrom Rack, the outlets at Opry Mills and some TJ Maxx stores that have the Designer section without having to worry about defects in the clothing.  However, visiting this location is worth it because you can find some random things that you might ""need.""  Just make sure to triple check for holes or loose stitching, etc.  They won't try to fix the defect and I doubt they would offer a lower price for it... not that anyone would want a new piece of clothing with problems with it anyway....

I walked up to the Menu shown outside of Surrey's and as I did, I saw a couple from behind walk pass me heading inside.  I saw very little signs of life at this point(aside from a couple Chinese Tourist), so thru the doors I went.\n\nInternally it has aesthetics of Tropical Vacation meshed with old school Cafe/Diner.  Waitstaff are fitting of the environment and redeemed ordering mistakes as another Table noticed something wrong.  Along side of the wall there are baskets of condiments/napkins hanging.  Of course the Louisiana staples were represented; Tabasco, Louisiana and Crystal.\n\nShrimp & Grits($12.50)\n\nSauteed Louisiana Gulf shrimp in New Orleans-style BBQ sauce over a bowl of Grits.  Garnished with Bacon, Green Onions and French Bread Croutons.\n\nTaste the BBQ sauce.  Buttery, creamy, bland.  I was surprised to taste the Ground Pepper having more characteristics than the BBQ sauce itself.  The Gulf Shrimps were pretty good and the Grits were creamy but when put together it just didn't have enough punch.  Now I know why HOT SAUCE is always available, stupid Tourist I know!\n\nI'm just glad there was Bacon because I finished that before even the Shrimp.  This Shrimp & Grits portion was quite sizable if you had Plantation labour work to do soon after because you'll need to burn off the calories.  For the folks in Canada, Grits taste like a grainy thick consistency Congee.  Imagine Seafood Congee with Buttery BBQ Sauce smothered on.   :D\n\nMore walking to do...

From the advice I had at an earlier establishment, there wouldn't be much more to peruse beyond this point anyways.\n\nI looked around the environment and most noticeably busy or with signs of retail shops was Oak st. which I made my way down to explore.  I even came across Jacque Imo's Cafe which was not open but I was drowning in my own sweat at this point and needed an Ice-cold beverage.  \n\nNot far from Jacque Imo's I noticed SMOKE coming out of this BBQ like a choo-choo Train.  Smell of BBQ Meat filled the air but as the staff was pulling the Meats out to make his way back to the Kitchen, I yelled across to ask if they had COLD Iced-Tea and he confirmed.  I've saved!\n\nI pulled the door open to see the Bar end of the restaurant and was lead towards the Dining area on the other side.  The setting was simple with some funky local Art to fill the void.  Iced-Tea was provided as I browsed the Menu since it happened to be Lunch time.\n\nNot feeling too hungry due to the heat, I decided to take the friendly Waitress's suggestion and start with the Duck appetizer right after I asked what they had as their Daily Dessert(Ice Cream!).\n\nSmoked Duck(app $4.95)\n\nSmokiness was infused thru-out which reminds me of Chinese style Tea-smoked Duck.  The Skin was crisp and flavoured with Sweet Habanero Glaze(I believe).  The accompanying Corn, Cilantro, Cabbage Slaw was refreshing and quite SPICY much like a Thai Salad.\n\nPortion wise was quite satisfying for the cost as it came with a piece of Thigh, Drum and WING.  It's a rarity to see Duck Wing served anywhere I've been aside from Asian restaurants so it was quite a treat.\n\nBoudin Balls(app $4.95)\n\nIt's my first taste of Boudin Ball or Boudin in general.  I have to say it's not on my list of favourite items.  Yeah, it has a crispy deep-fried outer shell but the Boudin filling lacked on flavour which I thought the reason for the Remoulade but even the sauce seemed flavourless.  The filling is evident that it was house-made using BBQ Pulled Pork which is appreciated but seasoning needs to be applied liberally.   2.5'd",2011-08-17,05:18:44

It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. \n\nThe cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out.

One day I was looking for something different for lunch so I consulted my food truck app, found where they were and headed to the corner of Loyola and Poydras. I lucked out and got a close parking spot on the corner that may or may not have been legal, but I was close enough to watch for the meter maids.\n\nI probably should have gone with a burger.

This lead to me getting black stuff from the grill on my shirt when I tried unlocking my door. I probably should have been more careful, but the sandwich was hanging out of the container. The second issue was the food itself. The sandwich was dry and tough and had a burnt taste. It seemed like it was left on the griddle far too long. Next up were the fries which were another disappointment. There was no spicy ketchup as promised. All that was in the container was some sort of citrus sauce. The fries were pretty dry and in need of sauce so, despite my dislike of citrusy sauces, I used what I had. The sauce did improve the fried greatly, but there wasn't enough of it. Part of the problem was that the sauce container wasn't sealed leading to much of the sauce draining to the bottom of the container. \n\nReading all of the other Yelp reviews makes me think that I visited this truck on a really off day.

A perfectly cooked brisket is something to behold and savor. Is DBBQ a perfect brisket? Negative. I've been twice and had sliced brisket both times.

My date and I were not that hungry so we just ordered the Seafood Grill Iron Skillet with the choice of scallops and a volcano roll. The scallops tasted interesting cooked in a white wine sauce. But when the food was complete I was kind of disappointed. The server told me that I'd be getting rice with noodles and vegetables, only one person out of the group had it. So I had little amounts of noodles and vegetables. And I was disappointed that they didn't have yummy yummy or goody goody sauce like Kobe or Arigato's (miss so much), BUT I was pleasantly surprised we were graced with an actual Japanese chef. I may sound like a giddy school girl, but that is rare to have one here. When the volcano roll arrived, I was stunned. It looked nothing like a volcano roll I've ever seen. Most places I've had it from it normally looked like a volcano erupted, but instead the presentation looked like a sad roll made of regular California roll with a glob of light orange mush on each piece. It wasn't even that spicy! I love spicy so we packed on the wasabi in the soy sauce until if finally reached my level of comfort. \n\nFor such small portions, our bill was surprising. For just 5 people, we were still charged for an 18% gratuity. We were feeling nice so we didn't complain about anything so we just let everything slide. I probably won't come back anytime soon.",2010-03-27,17:32:22

It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake! \n\nUpon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant\n\nI let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. \n\nWe ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. \n\nNo tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all...

While it is posted on your website for the Washington stop, some drivers still stop at the Alabama stop. This has happened twice and can be confusing. b) Yesterday, it appears the 7PM bus did not arrive. I am not sure of all the details, but there was a mad mod at the stop at 9PM. Thank God you had a good driver that night who was able to get many people on the 9PM from the 7PM in a polite manner and defuse the situation. But isn't this something that headquarters should have been able to solve? Its troubling to know I may not get on a bus I paid for because something happened and then the company has not planned for a bus to pick me up until the next schedule bus comes and let's all pray that bus has enough seats!\n\nOverall, Megabus Indy, you are a good company for low cost bus fare to Chicago.

Alter Ego is nice. and the usual suspects - Single Speed, Divided Sky, etc. - are solid, reliably good beers. \n\nbut i just don't see much point in visiting the brewery. there's rarely anything special or unavailable elsewhere. this time they were out of the Cuvee Diable, which left the One Hitter Quitter (malt liquor) (nope) and Vigilante (nice) as the only rare finds in the place. (compare this with Schlafly and Urban Chestnut and Perennial, all of which offer plenty of treasures to entice visitors.) i had the Passion Fruit Prussia, which i loved, but like everything else, it can be found outside the brewery, and none of it can be purchased for a growler. it doesn't seem like an intentional destination brewery, but an afterthought that they might as well sell the stuff on tap that they work so hard to package & retail. \n\nand finally, the music sucks big time. somebody(ies) with an attention deficit issue was shopping around satellite radio for anything under the sun, from Dr. Dog to Bill Withers to Kool & the Gang, and they switched off in the middle of the Commodores for the same damn Dr. Dog song a second time. boooo. just another suggestion that the brewpub effort lacks intention, the focus is on the retail. it was the last straw to convince me that i don't need to hang here anymore.",2015-07-06,13:53:07

Our server, Cassandra was excellent - very helpful with choosing a wine and helping us decide on dinner.  \n\nThe bread service here is kind of odd.  We each got a small roll, but there was no butter or olive oil, only a small bowl of very bland hummus.  We like hummus, but of the many varieties we've tried, this was the mildest and most uninteresting.  That was kind of the theme for the evening for me, unfortunately.  My wife had lobster risotto, which they've always touted as their house specialty.  I tasted it and it was good.  Lobster is very mild, especially when combined with tomato and cheese as this was.  The result was pretty much cheesy tomato risotto in terms of taste.  It was good, but not all that interesting.  \n\nFor my dinner, I had Osso Buco.  It was tender enough and pulled apart fine, but it was kind of dry and didn't have much flavor.  It made me wish I was having the carnitas at 3 Margaritas.  Also, it was served on polenta, which is pretty much flavorless and didn't help.  It did have a bit of sugary sauce mixed in, but not enough.  The asparagus spears served with it were okay.\n\nThe highlight was probably our Frito Misto appetizer, which was basically calamari, flash fried spinach and a quarter of lemon.  No sauce, but we really enjoyed it anyway.  \n\nSince it was our anniversary, they brought us tiramisu.  It was excellent and it was a great end to our meal.  \n\nThinking back to our last visit, when I thought the Lasagna was lacking in flavor, I sense a theme - the cooks at Trattoria Marcella have delicate taste buds.

For the middle of the holiday season and smack in the center of the St. Louis population, it sure was quiet.  They're in the middle of a pretty exclusive little mall, so maybe they do a good lunch business.   \n\nI asked myself after leaving:  if I was from out of town and stumbled in, would I recognize this as a place that's been around and lost whatever buzz it's had?

The menus seem kind of old, yes, but service is friendly, if not all that polished, and they're cranking out some pretty good food.\n\nWe had Tenderloin Broschettes and a seared scallop special.  Both were pretty good, around $20, with salads about $6 or so (also good).  Louis Martini cabernet was $32 a bottle - not bad for a good bottle of wine. \n\nNo complaints really, but it was just so quiet and kind of sad.  In the world of entertainment, ""kind of sad"" doesn't draw raves.   If this restaurant ever had buzz, it predates Yelp (3 reviews before me).  Maybe a makeover is in order.

The owner should be sentenced to five nights at the Venice Cafe.  This is the kind of restaurant an accountant would open.\n\nThey seem to be proud of their crabcakes, but they are bland on top of being unhealthy.  Putting one of these in a sandwich just doubles the blandness.   The mac and cheese was equally bland, which is very surprising for anyplace that bothers to list it as a meal.  I mean, just put some good cheese in there, for christ's sake.  How hard is that?  Sweet potato fries were overly sweet (maybe you like it that way - not us).  Cole slaw: bland. \n\nOn the positive side:  One of the items we got, the greek tilapia sandwich, was very good.

Not sure if the waitress spoke much English, since she sent an older guy - probably the owner - over to take my order.   The other tables we speaking English to her, so I don't know what was up with that.  Maybe it was my breath.  The menu looks a heck of a lot like some other local taquerias like Durango and La Pasadita.  All your basics are there.  The quality is very similar, too.  Anyway I got three tacos - asada, pollo and al pastor.  They were standard taqueria fare, except that the corn tortillas were served up fried almost to the point of being crispy.   Good stuff, except for a hunk of fat in my al pastor taco.  \n\nBottom line:  check it out if you like taqueria style Mexican.

The table was ready when we all got there and we had a good spot relative to the stage. The live music all evening was simply fantastic and a real treat.\n\nA few of us shared alligator as an appie, which wasn't too bad. Like a cross between chicken and calimari. It was a little pricey, but delicious all the same.\n\nOur server, Kathleen, was very friendly. She was pretty pushy with the alcohol, but it was kind of funny. (IE. My husband ordered a glass of wine and she asked him if he would like a bottle instead.) If you're ordering a martini, though, definitely supersize you order. It's $12 for a 2 oz or $24 for an entire pitcher!\n\nThe food was out of this world. I had the country fried chicken. It was very good, and the accompanying mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had (but don't tell my mom I said that)! I also loved the slaw the came with it. Light, kind of tangy. Yum!\n\nSo up to this point, everything is going swimmingly 5-stars. I'm stoked to go home and write my epic review of NOLA. And then this happens:\n\nMichael and I asked for our bill, since we were leaving before the rest of the table. The server gave our bill to me. I noticed at the bottom of the bill that the gratuity was included in the final total. That was because we were part of a large table, which is fine with me (although she probably should have said something at the beginning of the night or when she brought the bill over). I pulled out my credit card, but she said I would have to pay on the machine up at the front. That was no problem, and I started putting on my jacket and gabbing away at everyone.\n\nWhile I was saying goodbye to friends, Michael went to the front to pay our bill (which I didn't realize). Instead of re-printing the bill (which I still had in my hands back at the table), the server told Michael she remembered how much our bill was, and punched in the final number to the card machine. What she did NOT tell him was that the final number already included tip. So he went and added on 15% on top of our with-gratuity-total, and she never said a word. It wasn't until I finished chatting that I realized he had paid, and it wasn't until we got to the car that we realized what had happened. I'd like to give the server the benefit of the doubt and I hope it was an accident, but not telling your customer that gratuity is included in their bill is a major mistake to make.\n\nGreat night out, but definitely not worth our final cost, and I'm still angry about the way the night ended.",2011-11-25,15:23:42

The food was terrible, the atmosphere , blah and the service, indifferent.\n\nCame in on the last day of a Groupon deal Weds 4pm. Didnt get greeted by anyone , saw about 6 people at the bar, so we sat at a high top at the bar area.\n\nWe had two servers this visit, #1 we'll call Moppy cause of the hair, #2 we'll call sneezy cause he was sick. (I love sick people coming to work in a hospitality industry, servig food and rinks to people while sick-grrrr)\n\nSo Moppy comes over asks what we'd like to drink, hubby says ""mmm well not sure what you have"" while trying to see the taps at the bar or a drink menu. Moppy never says anything so we opt for two pumpkin beers we saw on the sign coming in. They were served in warm root beer mugs  @ $6.00 each.\n\nThen we got the complimentary chips and dressing. Have no idea why people rave about these. Ordinary ""homemade"" chips you get anywhere with a watered down sauce that tasted like a combination of Thousand Island and ranch. Not impressive.\n\nI was eyeing the beer cheese soup($3.29) but hubby wanted that so I got a cup of chili ($3.29) so we could taste a bit of each. The Texas chili (which BTW no self respecting Texan would ever put beans in a chili)  was soo hot , as in spicey hot, that I knew my stomach would kick my butt later so I couldn't eat and traded with hubby. I like hot food, but I know this must get sent back over and over cause Floridians don't do heat. The beer cheese soup didn't fare any better, it was watery and bland. The shredded cheese on top had more flavor than this gruel.\n\nSo Sneezy is done flirting with some excoworker that was sitting at the bar and he takes over serving us so Moppy can pick up where he left off with the girl.We opt to switch to another beer as the pumpkins are too heavy and we're finally told what they have and (Here's comes the BEST thing about this place) I find out they have Stella 2-4-1. Amazing, you don't get Stella 2-4-1 anywhere in this town! \n\nAfter another round we opt for food. French dip ($8.99)for me, with added sauteed mushrooms ($1.00) and a fried pork chop sandwich($8.99) for Daddy'o.\nOh the disappointment. The french dip came sans mushrooms which took me a minute to discover as I thought the little black burnt things might have been a remnant of said funghi but no, it was just burnt food. Hubby breaded pork chp was breaded so poorly the breading was pulling away from the chop before he even bit into it. It was dry and the spicy sauce (not spicy) couldn't even assist this fiasco. Both sandwiches were served with ""house seasoned fries"" That has to be a joke. These are straight out of the bag Ore Ida crinkle fries sprinkled with something red with no taste.\n\nAll in all, we found the service to be lackadaisical, the food to be horrendous and the atmosphere bland and boring. I would only return for 2-4-1 Stellas and I don't think they could get me happy enough to enjoy the food here, it was THAT bad.",2012-09-27,15:36:08

We walked right in at 8 to a nearly empty restaurant and were seated. The menu on the website does not reflect what they accurately serve in house - downfall #1. Having lived here for 3 years and been a faithful customer to another Italian place down the block, I was happy to try something different and REALLY disappointed when the server explained they hadn't updated the website since La Belle Epoqe re-opened - the dishes I was inquiring about were now served there. \n\nTo sum it up, the food was ok - not great. It is overpriced & OVERSPICED! The lobster ravioli should be called tarragon ravioli... This supposed Italian-Spanish inspired quisine falls a little short. Oh and our server spoke French, lol! \n1 Caesar salad\n1 beet salad\n2 glasses of white wine\n2 pasta dishes\n=$90+ gratuity?!?!\nI'll probably be back at my regular spot down the block for amazing fare & 1/2 the price.",2010-04-04,00:03:33

Due to the high volume of guests at the resort, they opened Cayton's up for dinner on a Sunday night. We had a pretty large group, so we played it safe and went with the restaurant that could accommodate us all, and they certainly did! Upon arrival we were directed to a private dining room. From a service stand point, I'd say it was a five-star experience. The staff was super friendly and extremely patient with our rowdy group. The food on the other hand was A-Ok. Cayton's menu lists over ten different gourmet burgers, salads, sandwiches and even adult shakes, including one called THE DUDE. That alone might we be worth an additional star. \n\nMenu items come with catchy names like ""Home on the range"" (a buffalo burger), the Belushi and the No Substitutions ( a quarter pound burger with three cheeses, pancetta, bacon and a bunch more). Burgers are no more expensive than Zin Burger. I ordered the Home on the Range buffalo burger which was served with oaxaca cheese, guacamole, and cilantro mayo with a side of tater tots. I should've gone with the Belushi. The patty was bright red and definitely appeared undercooked for my taste, but considering it was a buffalo patty, which tends to be leaner, I'm guessing that was the intention of the kitchen. Several others in our group ordered the Jabroni which was loaded with two patties, pancetta, capicola, mozzarella and a few other items I can't recall. It was definitely a heavy choice!  The hit of the night was definitely the DUDE shake. \n\nSince we were there at night we didn't get to catch the views of the golf course. The restaurant itself is certainly upscale. Since I don't golf, I don't imagine myself returning here for a meal anytime soon. It appeared as though the bathrooms also served as locker rooms for women, which were not very clean. Perhaps this was an oversight, given that they opened up on an off-night. \n\nOver all, Cayton's was a fun choice for our group. We were especially thankful for the shuttle to and and from the resort, otherwise we might have ended up on the 10th green...alone...in the dark.",2014-05-29,06:35:18

I love spas so much I worked in one while I was in college. My expectation for this experience was that it would be a three. It's an old location that hasn't really been updated so I set the bar at 3-stars. My sister was visiting from far away for my birthday and my husband booked us a massage day together. We also chose this location based on proximity to where she was staying in case her 1 year old needed anything right away. \n\nIn any case- two signature massages were booked. When we arrived we were greeted and taken to the back locker area and were given our lockers. We did not receive a tour of the faculties- but there's not much there any way. Just the basics- showers, steam and sauna. The locker room only had one private changing room, which I found a little odd. Thankfully it was stocked up with plenty of amenities. \n\nThe waiting room is supposed to a relaxing experience. It's more like all the old hotel furniture clumped into one room. It had zero spa vibe at all. The waiting lounges I've experienced have always been set up for clients to w joy while waiting for their appointments or to go back to after a treatment and kick back and relax. Missed the market there. \n\nThe biggest issue for us is that when we were greeted we realized that one of the massage therapists was male. This caught us off guard and my sister did not feel comfortable with a male therapist. So I took her slot. Having worked in spa reception... it was not only customary but a requirement to ask the client if they have a preference in therapist. Or at least to advise them that a particular time/date they were inquiring about was with a male therapist only. It's not fair to the customer or the employee to be caught off guard like that. I find this unprofessional on their part. Additionally- the massage was pretty underwhelming. I've had all kinds of massage treatments from deep tissue to hot stone and shiatsu. I simply asked for a calming and relaxing treatment. I felt the treatment was rushed. \n\nMy sister enjoyed her massage and I'm happy she did as spa days are something she does not do very often.  \n\nMy husband prepaid for our treatments and gave a gratuity in advance. The receptionists on the way out didn't even ask how the treatments were. \n\nOverall I find this particular spa to be below average at the high end prices they charge. Customer service should be seamless and all questions and preferences regarding massage therapist should be addressed upon booking.",2017-07-19,05:52:28

The waiter was friendly and helpful, but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out. \n\nThe decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. \n\nThe menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. \n\nOverall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. \n\nBTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a ""cheese"" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've ""been around"" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert.

The kitchen closed early around 7pm, so we were starving while the host was desperately trying to stall for time.

That was my favorite thing about it -- they had the largest karaoke rooms I've ever been in, with two couches to lounge in. They even had a small kitchen counter off to the side, in case you wanted to serve drinks or something I guess. It was like being in my own living room, it was that comfortable.\n\nThey've got large tv screens for the karaoke, and a good selection of songs in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. The only thing about this place though, is that you have to manually write down the songs you want with pencil and paper. Most karaoke bars nowadays let you select your songs with a remote control, but it's the old-fashioned way here.

I brought my boyfriend and my 13 year old niece - who was OH so excited about the ducks!!! \n\nWe had planned to ride on Friday, but found out that the tickets were sold out - so planned ahead for Sunday, and bought tickets for a Noon tour on Sunday. We were told to meet the group at 11:45 at 6th & Chestnut. \n\nOn Sunday morning, we arrived at 6th & Chestnut, but did not see any Duck boat! We waited and then finally went back towards the Visitors Museum, and asked for clarification. The girl at the counter looked at me as if I was a moron when I asked where the Duck was departing from! \n\nSo, at 11:59, they were about to close the door on the Duck - and we ran over and just made it on! Panting from running, they forced us to take a group photo and then we boarded. \n\nThe Tour Guide / Comedian / Driver was hilarious & he really knew his lines well. The tour combined music with history with jokes, and everything was timed perfectly!! I think the leaders must have to spend many days in training for this job. Overall, the tour was well worth the money and I'm glad that we went! It was a blast. I learned a lot about Philadelphia - and I've been living here for a few years! The Duck tour was one of my niece's highlights from her visit to see her Aunt. \n\nWhen we arrived back at the Visitors Center at 1:15pm, we were immediately greeted by Duck Tour employees with our photographs in their hands. They had pre-printed them out, and put them into nice little envelopes for us to purchase for the small price of $21. No thank you! \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the tour and I would recommend it to others. HOWEVER, Please be cautious, as you never know where you're actually going to board for the tour. AND I think the company should think more green - and not waste the paper and chemicals on printing everyone's photographs, which are bound to be thrown in the trash if not purchased. #wasteful \n\nP.S.

The lady that was supposed to be our waitress decided to show up for like 10 seconds; she says your Whiskey will be coming out and left. Our waitress did not let us order dinner.\n\nAfter like other 10 minutes without listening from our waitress we decided to ask the bartender if they could please find her so we could order our dinner. Then she came back with waters and the drinks; we told her we wanted to order food. So we ordered a sandwich and a burger. Then she left, and we did not see her anymore. \nThe first lady that greeted us kept on checking on us and asking if we were doing ok. Then she said she was going to be our waitress for the next hour. So we got excited. \n\nWe ask her if she could ask the guys at the bar to put on TV the Warriors game. They have a lot of TVs because this bar is by the Sports betting section in the casino. For some strange reason, they were not able to play the game. I mean we have access at home, and they don't?\n\nTo make the story shorter, the waitress who took our order and left did not order hour food. We waited for like 40 minutes, and then I ask the good server to check what happened with our food, and she comes back to retake the order.\n\nWe re-order our dinner (that tells you how patient I am), then we wait. I had another Jefferson's Ocean and waited for the food. The food came, it was Ok. Decent burger and sandwich. After dinner, we pay the check, and the server apologized for what happened, as a courtesy, she gave me one of the drinks for free.

The chickpea salad could have been great, but it far too salty due the large amount of capers included.  On to the sandwich... what to say?  It just wasn't good.  I was expecting fresh, flavorful ingredients that would blow away my taste buds.  Instead I got what tasted like a two-day-old sandwich with dry, bland turkey and gross bread.  The bread was sourdough, but was *really* sour, with dense, doughy texture; it crumbled in my hands every time I picked it up.

With an empty dining room, which only began to fill in as we left, the space felt comfortable, airy, and modest.  Service was attentive, if not a little awkward due to the silence and our proximity to the kitchen door/curtain.  Our server was well informed, and more importantly willing to find out when he didn't know.  He did seem a bit peeve-y about our selection of three small plates to share in lieu of seconds, but I suppose I might have been too.\n\nThe primary reason for my visit, it turns out, is also the primary reason I'm not giving The Farm and Fisherman only one star - and that is the Bloody Beet Steak.  This decadent, rich and original preparation of a vegetable I love made me croon, swoon, etc.  The reduction was perfectly salty and smokey and the yogurt lifted the whole darn dish all the way up to high heaven.  Delightful.\n\nThat praised, the Heirloom Tomatoes and Tilefish we sampled went down like chicken broth in a hospital bed.  I know we were a tad bit early on tomato season - but then why were they on the menu?  I grow more flavorful tomatoes amidst the smog on my South Philly rooftop.  They were over ripe and under flavored, and though the burrata cruelly enveloped therein was wonderful, it could not save the dish.  Please TRY the tomatoes before they are offered to the public - especially for $11.\n\nTo preface this qualm, I like Tilefish.  Yes it is inconsequential in flavor and texture, but I enjoy it in many diverse culinary incarnations.  This tilefish, while properly cooked, didn't even really count as a ""culinary incarnation.""  Under-seasoned - if it was seasoned at all - and granted only the company of those same underwhelming tomatoes and some mushy pickled blueberries similarly lacking in both tartness and/or sweetness, that sad piece of lovely fish sat floating in a sea of broth so softened into nothingness that it didn't even pack the punch of a glass of water.  Bummer.\n\nAs I am all about farm to table, and am a huge fan of supporting urban foraging, I hope that our dull experience was only due to the misfortune of visiting The Farm and Fisherman on an off-day for the ever-changing menu.  Another visit may be in order some day, but for now my hype-drive has waned and I'm content to let others gamble on sapor - and we're not talking penny slots here.

(my car was only 3 years old and under 25k miles). additionally some part inside the car would shake when i was driving it as well causing an annoying rattle as if some panel were loose. given that this repair had a lifetime guarantee with my insurance, i could have gone through additional trouble to have it looked at and fixed. but luckily, i was able to sell my car 3 months after the repair, so i didn't have to deal with all the exasperating problems for much longer or having to bring it back to a shop to fix the problems. given all the trouble i had gone through to get my car fixed, both during the process and after the repair, (and if i had known) i would have taken the insurance check and given up the car.",2014-10-28,02:01:45

I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only.

It was hard to hear the live performer because the music was way too loud. I went to a Bruno Mars concert at the Fox's Theater in Atlanta two years ago and the sounding was much better (Of course Bruno's singing is still godly!). However, the lighting was awesome! The lightning is what I love best about this place. \n\nI was lucky to grab floor seating for the Bruno Mars's concert. I was placed in these tiny chair closely placed next to each other. Although the chair was comfortable, I wish they didn't put the chairs so close together or get bigger chairs (I am pretty petite so that says something!). At the concert, this one obese lady was siting next to me and she literally sat on her chair and 30% of my chair...her ""boyfriend"" put his arm around her neck and kept hitting my shoulder (and tried to hit on me too -__-). I barely had room to stand or dance when standing up because she hogged the space (no pun intended). \n\nThe food was average to me. My friend liked the fried chicken tenders a lot but I thought it was bland. Also, they don't let you carry water/soda in a bottle. Any drinks have to be put in a cup so the crazy fans can't throw the bottles around. \n\nTraffic is horrible every time there is a big event. Arrive here 1 hour early to avoid the traffic and find parking as most of the closer parkings are filled up quickly.

The burger gods must have been smiling down on us because it was only a 30 minute wait for a table, so we headed over to Ten Stone for a beer.\n\nAs we got back to P&K, it got considerably busier, so we had to snake through the crowd to get to our tiny little table at the back of the bar.  We decided to just go with food tonight and save the specialty cocktails for another day.  My original plan was to get the burger since there's so many rave reviews about it, but then I was slapped with an orecchiette pasta special with a duck ragout that I just couldn't say no to.  (After all, the boyfriend ended up getting the burger, so a couple bites would be enough to see if it lives up to the hype.)\n\nThe entrees came out.  They looked so good...They smelled heavenly. ..They tasted delicious.  The pasta dish was just an appetizer, but it was delicious.  The duck ragout was very tasty and tasted like it was home cooked all day (just like Grandma would have done it).  My only complaint - the pasta was topped with walnuts that seemed completely unnecessary; even having them for show didn't do anything for the plate.  Still good though.  The burger was big, juicy and delicious.  My boyfriend even said it easily rivaled the burgers at Whiskey Village.  \n\n***I'd like to go on record for just a second:  I completely disagree with his review of this burger.  So far no burger compares to the gloriousness of a Village Whiskey burger!***\n\nThis burger happened to be topped with blue cheese and red onions.  I wasn't a fan of the red onions, but the rest of the burger was absolute perfection.  He also ordered a side of fries, which I thought were delicious.\n\nAll-in-all, P&K delivered up some damn good grub.

I went here for dinner with two of my friends for Media's Dining Under the Stars.  (For anyone who's not familiar, Dining Under the Stars happens Wednesday nights in Media and State Street is blocked off so restaurants can set up tables outside.)\n\nFirstly, let me say that service here is excellent!  Possibly the best service that I've ever had.  I honestly wish I could remember our waitress' name, but I can't.  She was awesome!\n\nSecondly, Temaki is BYOB.  Enough said. \n\nFinally, the sushi is pretty good.  All of us started off with the kani salad as an appetizer.  The dish is sort of on the small side compared to some other places I've had it, but it's pretty tasty.  Some places make it so spicy that it's hard to eat, but Temaki does it right.  For dinner, we ordered several rolls to share including: the asparagus roll, shrimp tempura roll, bamboo roll, salmon tempura roll, california roll, and philly roll with an order of shrimp sushi and kani sushi.  Everything came out well-prepared and tasted delicious!  I read another recent Yelp review about the avocado being bad during her experience, but thankfully this was not my experience at all - nice and bright green!  My two friends didn't have any comments on how their sushi was, because they were busy stuffing their faces.  I can comment, however, on the two rolls that I had:  the bamboo roll and the salmon tempura roll.  The bamboo roll was just okay in my book.  Like I said, the avocado was nice and fresh, but it was lacking on the amount of spicy yellowtail.  (I couldn't taste it at all!)  The waitress told me that the salmon tempura roll doesn't get ordered often, which makes me sad because it was delicious!  I'll definitely be adding it my list of favorites.  The kani sushi was good and fresh, but I was expecting two pieces per order like most other places offer it.  No biggie, I guess.\n\nTemaki is one of my favorite places in Media and, in my opinion, much better than the over-crowded, non-BYOB, Azie.  Check it out!",2012-08-09,17:28:09

We walked in on a rainy Wednesday night, which is why I thought this place might be a ghost town, but after reading some other reviews I think it just might be like that a lot.  Sad :(\n\nThe downstairs is really nice and clean.  I'm not really sure how to describe the decor, but it included some ""old-timey"" jars/bottles/stuff, which I liked a lot.   I didn't venture upstairs but heard there is darts and shuffle board up there.  \n\nOriginally, I was going to get some drink with muddled cucumber in it (I just liked how ""muddled cucumber"" sounded, definitely a good band name in my opinion), but I decided to go with some bourbon flights instead.  ""When In Rome,"" I thought.  Let's just say that I quickly found out that bourbon is just not my thing and had to suffer through three mini glasses of rubbing alcohol, at no fault of the restaurant (at least I was trying to be adventurous, right?).  My BF had a old fashioned and also learned that he didn't like it either.  We tried!\n\nFor dinner we got the crawfish mac & cheese, lamb sliders, and twisted house burger.  The crawfish mac & cheese was the highlight of the meal.  It was decadent and delicious with just enough crawfish in it.  Being someone who needs to pour sriracha on all mac & cheese, this was good enough just as it is.  I definitely recommend it!  The sliders were on the dry side and were just okay.  My BF said the burger was good and juicy, but they went a little overboard on the blue cheese.\n\nOn a lighter note, service was spot on - they did a really great job here.\n\nAll-in-all, I wanted this place to be awesome, but it just didn't do it for me.  I may come back in the future to see some live music (Wednesday night is blues night) and, of course, to order that mac & cheese, but I'm really not planning on going here anytime soon.\n\nPS - If you go to the Twisted Tail website and print out the August calendar, you get 10% off your dinner menu.

Service was quick so no complaints there, but I made the mistake of not mentioning my coupon before service was performed (even though the person who checked me in saw it in my hand), so I missed out on using the coupon.  I've learned my lesson.\n\nThe next time, I came back because my tire pressure light was on.  They checked the air pressure on each of the tires and added air to the one that needed it for free.

The issues ranged from missing items, to incorrect items, to taking an order for mozzarella sticks when you were out of them and not notifying the customer before pickup occurred. Most recently, our order was ""lost"" and then it had turned out that it was given to another customer - we ended up waiting almost an hour to receive our order all while dealing with a rude cashier who made a few attempts to get us to pay before actually receiving our order, which, in the end, was incorrect yet again.

Before we headed upstairs to the tiny music venue, we decided to get some dinner and drinks.  It wasn't packed for a Friday night and we were able to get a table for six easily, which was awesome.\n\nQuick blurb on the architecture of this venue:  It is awesome.  I'm not even sure how to describe it, but when you're in there, make sure you turn your eyes upward to check out all of the cool details.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the drink menu is inserted into old children's books.  It's a little creepy in ways, but an interesting touch that I haven't seen anywhere else.  Kudos for being creative!  I started with the Irish Jolly, which was awesome.  I really liked the flavor of the black berries with the Jameson.  After that, I moved on to the Dark & Stormy - pretty standard, really delicious.\n\nNote:  Bourbon & Branch has FIVE $5 city wide specials.  If I wasn't driving that night, I would have had one of each.  I love when bars do this.\n\nFor appetizers, we split the Irish Nachos and the Fried Pickles.  The Irish Nachos were loaded up with bacon and beer cheddar cheese sauce, which was delicious.  As  personal preference, I could have done without the ""Irish"" part of the Irish Nachos (the kettle chips), but that's just me.  (Give me nachos; give me fries!  You can keep the chips.)  The fried pickles were pretty good.  They were perfectly fried, not too salty, and accompanied by a honey mustard sauce.  I would probably order those again.\n\nFor dinner, I went with the wild mushroom pie.  (For those that don't know, the ""pies"" are pizzas.  Some at my table thought they were actual pies, so it was a bit of a surprise when we got our orders.)  The pizza was delicious - piled high with sauteed mushrooms and bacon.  It was a touch on the salty side, but it was so good that it didn't matter.  I didn't get much of the truffle oil taste, which was a little disappointing.  All-in-all, I would order it again.  \n\nI got to taste a few of the other entrees (the bang bang chicken, pulled pork chicken, and the fish tacos), but the fish tacos were a clear winner in my book.  The fish (I believe it was basa or tilapia) was cooked perfectly and the sriracha aioli gave it a real kick in the tastebuds.  I loved them!\n\nWe also had dessert...because why not?  The Guinness Float was not my cup of tea.  It was thick in a weird way.  I guess I was expecting something like a car bomb, but instead got a soupy Guinness with a root beer aftertaste and too much whipped cream.  No thanks!  The whiskey brownie had potential, but the actual brownie was hard in texture.  Really wish this would have been warmed beforehand.   But having those be my two major complaints really isn't bad at all.  \n\nThe service was decent, drinks were awesome, and food was pretty good.

It retains the smaller seating area by the entrance, and has added a large outdoor bar. \n\nI ended up there twice in recent months. The first I met up with people for happy hour. We started outside, gathered around a long hightop table. There was a good selection of beers out there, though different from inside. There was adequate shade for the late afternoon sun, but the humidity got to be a bit much, as with any outdoor bar. Once everyone showed up, we decided to move inside.\n\nThe bar is downstairs from the main entrance, and our large group colonised the large high-top in the middle of the bar area. It had some of those self-service taps you sometimes see at large sportsbars, but we didn't try them out. The beer list inside was much more expansive, with plenty of choices for all tastes. There's also a large variety of appetizers. I had the buffalo chicken dip, with pita wedges, and also tried some buffalo popcorn chicken and  alligator tacos, and everything was pretty good.\n\nI went back a few weeks later for dinner. We sat in the dining area, in a slightly uncomfortable highbacked booth.

After a few minutes, someone came out from a back room to take my order.\n\nI ordered a burger medium, with only  basic toppings. The result was disappointing.  The burger, while clearly made of quality meat and perfectly sized, was very dry and somewhat bland. I think the brioche bun is at the heart of the issue, it muted the flavor of the meat.  The burger was decidedly on the well done side of medium, The sautéed onions were cold, like they'd just come off a fixins bar.\n\nA later visit produced better results. I got one of their specialty burgers, medium rare this time. That definitely made for a juicier, more flavorful sandwich, that pulled in the toppings to a better package. I'm still not a fan of the bun. The burger was cooked the way I asked, and the toppings didn't fell like as much of an afterthought. Service was also better on my second visit, as I got served much more quickly.\n\nI tried their spicy fries, and they were very good. Not overwhelmed with spice like Five Guys cajun fries, the amount of seasoning produced a good result, that didn't ruin my taste buds' ability to enjoy the burger. I also enjoyed that their soda fountain breaks free of name brands, it's a good change of pace.\n\nIt's a small place, I imagine it can fill up quickly at lunchtime, but it makes a good stop for food.

The calamari were fork tender. Absolutely perfect. There was just a tiny crunch from a whisper of breading, I think maybe cornmeal, and the sauce wasn't overkill.\n\nMy entree was a large salad with chopped romaine, chicken, kalamata and green olives, parmesan cheese, tomatoes, pepperoncinis and portabellas (but I got hardboiled eggs instead). The roasted garlic balsmaic dressing was too sweet for me, so I just ate it naked. Never did that before but it was surprisingly delicious.\n\nMy friend got the tilapia reuben with fries and seemed to enjoy it.\n\nI loved this place when it was Lynch Street Bistro for the same reason I love it now - the ambiance. The inside is cozy and inviting and the outside is perfect for summer - a great al fresco place. The food might need just a bit more work, but I think it's on its way to being well seasoned.",2008-04-08,20:11:42

When we go on vacation to the Poconos, the community we stay in has a great pottery-painting activity room, and I've painted countless ceramic representations of aquatic life (badly) while in Mexico on vacation.

Unfortunately, it didn't really measure up. \n\nOffense to decency 1: there is a ""sitting charge."" In addition to paying a fairly high price for the ceramics, which I would think should cover the cost of paint, supplies, etc, they charge $9 per person just to sit down!\n\nThis, coupled with the cost of the pottery, led to a $50 bill for me to paint a small bowl (a ""nut bowl,"" as they called it), and my wife to paint a coffee mug. \n\nOffense to decency 2: the wait time. The stated wait time to get our pottery back was 7-10 business days! And, while it ended up being 5, that still seems kind of excessive. In Mexico, they would tell you to go back to the pool when you were done and they had your pottery glazed (and professionally fixed of any errors!) within like 2 hours. Fine, maybe it's not the same thing, but 8 days?\n\nOn a positive note: the staff was nice enough, and there were a good selection of paints of brushes.

Definitely the best I've had to this day.\n\nI ordered the turkey BLT for my dinner, which was served on a pretzel bun. It was good, don't get me wrong.

Hot water cascades down your body during the entire treatment as you are massaged with hot stones and oils.  I felt guilty for wasting so much water, but it was so relaxing.  So I guess I didnt feel that guilty.  Anyway, the $25 shampoo add-on was NOT worth it.  It just took time away from other body parts being massaged, and my hair did not feel very clean afterward--just very oily.  \n\nIn all, while I really liked the treatment, I like a full service spa when on vacation, and the facilities just didnt not measure-up.",2010-03-03,02:39:14

But I wanted to see a certain major studio film on the big screen.  I'd been to the Bridge when I lived in LA, so I was excited to check out the Philly version.  \n\nLike the West Coast Bridge, this theater is stylish, clean and has stadium seating.  You can grab a drink before/after the film, and you get an assigned seat.  Unlike the West Coast, this theater is affordable--this Bridge is much cheaper here.  I LOVED that.\n\nI settled on 3 stars because the theater was about a 4 and the crowd was about a 1.  In the ""media immersion room,"" where you can text your name and see it on a big screen, clever kids send in names like ""cockmaster"" and ""____ is a homo"" and other things about people enjoying sex with animals.  Classy.\n\nIn the theater, two young women (apparently about 16--too young for rated R--because they were at a family movie) talked, kicked each other, wrestled, squealed, and watched stuff on their cellphones.  They were in my row and kept running to different seats as they played around.  They got up to leave (loudly) only to come back and start again.  One girl made a phone call.  No hushed voice, no indoor voice, but the voice you use when you are on a cell phone in a wind storm while standing next to a moving train.  ""I'm at a movie.  I'm with _____!  Blah Blah Bah!""\n\nBehind me, kids screamed, cried, kicked my seat (they had four adults with them), and loudly opened the bags of food they'd sneaked in.  One moved to sit next to me after his family/friends picked on him. Kids reached between us to punch him.  They threw popcorn so that I had it in my hair.  People talked out loud to each other and to the screen.\n\nSince it was a family film, I expected a bit of chatter and understood when I little girl had a freakout when the villain entered the scene.  But this was out of control.  I considered complaining, but I knew the manager couldn't throw out the entire audience for my moviewatching enjoyment.  \n\nI tried to watch the credits to find out the name of a song in the film and was annoyed when the house lights went up and employees began sweeping around me.  I understand that our ill-behaved audience left a mess and they had another screening, but the film wasn't really over for me yet.\n\nIn all, I'll go back to netflix for my Center City moviegoing unless it's a film a the Ritz.  I can't blame the theater for most of my negative experience.  I think it's just the behavior in Philly theaters that bothers me.

The noodles are a bit too chewy (though props for being made in-house), and the flavor combinations are heavy on the ""sweet and sour"" aspect so characteristic of Asian fusion.

Came here to see Cirque du Soleil's Dralion, and for that the venue was good. We had balcony seats, but really it's not a huge theater so any section would probably be fine for viewing the stage. The seats themselves look like cheap plastic, but were reasonably comfortable for a two hour performance. The tall boyfriend suffered from no legroom, but he's used to that by now.\n\nThey basically trap you inside. We wanted to get in early because Cirque usually sends in the clowns pre-show while everyone is getting seated, so we didn't have time to grab a bite from outside the venue. $6 hot dog? No thanks. Unfortunately, no pre-show either. Well, over an hour later during the twenty minute intermission, we figured we had enough time to grab something from the Wendy's next door. We were told that if we left we wouldn't be able to get in again. I said I just wanted to pop out for a smoke, and was directed to another exit... which was blocked off from the outside with steel barricades, allowing smokers a tiny triangle to puff away but no way to actually leave the venue. So we caved and picked up a $6 hotdog (in a stale bun) and a $4 small bottle of Sierra Mist, and then a $5 ice cream cone. Stupid. Also the lobby and vendors are dingy looking.\n\nSo yeah, no need to avoid this place if there's something you want to see, but definitely allocate some time for eating out beforehand.

The Sultans of Schlep popped out as a moving company with outstanding reviews which, like, never ever happens, so I dropped them an email asking for a quote, and left my number as well. I get a reply from Tom two days later, which is a little on the high side, but I'd rather pay more for peace of mind than risk a craptastic move. Two days later, I email back, confirming that I'd like to go ahead, and could he please call my boyfriend to schedule a move for sometime this week. The next day, we haven't heard anything, so my boyfriend calls referencing the email and leaves a message. Another day passes, still nothing, so we call again, but calls just go to voicemail. \n\nWe eventually scheduled our move with another company I dredged up from craigslist, which actually turned out okay, but to this day I never heard back from Tom, either in response to my email or to the voicemail message that was left for him. More like Sultans of Schmegegge if you ask me.\n\nTwo stars because, FWIW, they didn't break anything.\n\nEdit: In response to the owner's comment below, note that I mentioned that both an email and a voicemail message were not returned. Additionally, I had provided the desired time frame of my move in my initial August 5 email, which was the only one to which I received a reply, so Tom could have told me then that he was going to be out of town. This isn't just a criticism of the company's attentiveness to voicemail, but email as well; I would say that responding to customers is a pretty important criterion for rating a business. And the curious fact remains that I received a response to my Yelp comment within minutes, and yet my August 9 email - and August 10 voicemail message - were never returned. What is true, though, is that this won't happen again, at least not for me.\n\n'nother edit: Well, maybe next time a potential customer requests a quote and provides a time frame which coincides with a stretch when you're going to be out of town, it wouldn't hurt to mention it when you first reply.

I figured this would be easy enough and volunteered to place the order. The arrangement itself was quite modest but a hefty $57 plus $12 for delivery. I applied a $5 coupon so it came out to $64.\n\nThe bouquet was delivered directly to the admin staff on Wednesday, April 24. I briefly saw the impressive arrangement on the desk at reception, went off to class, and when I came back a couple of hours later, only the ""thank you"" balloons were left. I was a little disappointed that there were none left for me to try, but happily wrote a glowing review on Yelp.\n\nTwo days later, the association chair asked me if I knew that the fruit was still in the refrigerator in the break room. I went to check it out, and sure enough it was there, evidently re-wrapped with a few pieces missing. Very strange! On my way home, I made a point of saying goodbye to one of the office staff, and reminded her with a smile to not forget to take the fruit bouquet home with her. She smiled back and said she would. \n\nI had to come in the following day, a Saturday, and sure enough the arrangement was still in the refrigerator. By that point the fruit was visibly rotten and certainly inedible. The next week I did some snooping around and learned that the staff had tried some of the fruit but it was bad, only they didn't have the heart to tell us.\n\nI contacted Edible Arrangements via their website, explained what had happened, and asked if they would make it right. I received a call from one of their representatives, and he offered to either send a replacement or provide a refund, less the delivery fee and 30%. I opted for the refund.\n\nThe same day, the business owner responded to my (then positive) review, thanking me. Had they not responded, I would have just edited the review and knocked down the star rating, but their response would have looked really odd in light of a bad review so I decided to just delete it and post a new review after the refund kicked in. \n\nAnd here's where it gets ridiculous.\n\nLater in the week, I checked my statement and noticed a refund of $17.10 from Edible Arrangements. If you're following along, the refund was supposed to be 70% of the cost of the bouquet alone (not delivery), which was $52 (after my $5 coupon), so the refund should have been $36.40. I sent a follow-up email to Edible Arrangements, and they responded telling me that in light of my positive Yelp review (which, they noted, I deleted), I should never have received any refund in the first place, and that as far as they are concerned the case is closed.\n\nI replied clarifying what had happened, including the fact that I was going to be reimbursed from the grad student association funds anyway, so it's not as though I had anything to gain personally from a refund. Still, six days later, no response, no refund.\n\nSo here's your review back, Edible Arrangements. I hope you're happy.\n\nEDIT: And for some fun reason, the business comment re-applied to this review automatically. Doesn't it look weird?\n\n(And here it is in case it's removed, so my edit makes sense: ""Thanks for the wonderful response .....We pride ourselves with great service !!!!!!

People who understand and appreciate food don't go to pubs to consume great food. People go to pubs to socialize, get wasted, and get into fights. You can feed most of them fried Little Caesar's pizza (aka ""cardboard""), tell them it's ""chicken fingers"", and they would be happier than drunk people in a pub.\n\nSecond, for food, I avoid any place that has the word ""English"" in it. To paraphrase Rick Steves, the expert on European travel, ""When traveling in England, eat to just not starve"". The English are known for their universities, their global naval conquests, their music, their Magna Carta, but *never* for their food. Their ""famous"" foods are fish & chips and curry. The former you can get just as well from a drive-thru (!) and the latter came from South Asian immigrants who, upon arriving in the UK, said, ""WTF is all this crap they call 'food'? Let's show them what food is.""\n\nSo this place has a double whammy against it. It doesn't just have mediocre pub food but it mediocre *English* pub food. It's like a TV dinner isn't mediocre enough so you get a *Walmart* brand TV dinner. It's mediocrity at its most exceptional, if there is such a thing.\n\nBut I give it three stars because it gave my alumni group some considerate accommodations and it has TVs all over the place.

In general, they are very unprofessional and terrible with customer service and communication. First of all, they don't call you back. Leave as many voicemails as you want (if the mailbox isn't full), and give them your phone number, but don't count on a call back, even after the work is done and your car is ready to go. I've had this happen on multiple occasions when I've had my car serviced here. Secondly, the owner has a very short fuse and a bad temper. The last time I was there I witnessed him scream and yell inside one of the bays (when a repair wasn't going well) and then kick the metal garage door in anger. He'll also jump down your throat the instant you question something he says, inquire about why a repair is taking a long time or simply try to talk to him while he's busy. He seems too high strung and impatient to be in this business. If you get him on a good day, he can be really nice and helpful, but I noticed since they moved to this location, and are more busy now because of it, that he's a lot more on edge. I would also question this shop's quality of work, as the last time I had my car in there, I left the shop with another problem (that wasn't a problem before I went in), but I refuse to take the car back given the above issues, so I am currently seeking out a new shop to have my car repaired.

His drink came out okay, my martini was green. I apologized to the server. I explained myself. I bartend. I drink, a lot. My martini really shouldn't be this salty or this shade. He apologized and took it back. After quite sometime (I am in the industry... I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand.

I used to make the incorrect assumption that this location was a chain but actually, it's sole operation is in Willow Grove. \n\nI'll start with the menu. It's selections are rather widespread, and you'll get a good return for under $6 which is very affordable. Unfortunately, the menu board (which is Ralph's best selling point because of the low prices and variety), is tucked behind the counter in such a way that you have to look through any of up to six different paneled windows depending on whether you want pizza, cold cuts, cheesesteak, or a hot sandwich, plus whatever drinks or sides. \n\nWith ample parking and a long counter, I've never had to wait long to get served a meal. That being said, there's not a lot to look forward to when dining here. The cheesesteaks have decent ingredients but the roll is par, nothing fancy.  The on site eating is outdoors only.  The counter is often greasy, and both stools look like they definitely could have been trashpicked more than once. There is no ketchup stand or condiment stand to speak of.  I don't particularly enjoy tearing open 14 ketch-up packets to be able to finish one sandwich with fries anyway.  \n\nRalph's of Philly would be what you expect to find when looking for a decent cheesesteak out of town and finding only almost satisfactory. I think I would like to eat there again if it were the only cheesesteak in town.  Problem is, this location is not far enough out of town to make it here and it certainly does not stack up vs. any competition.\n\nThe pizza, which I viewed behind the counter, was not appealing enough for me to order so I can't review that aspect of Ralph's.",2010-08-13,18:47:52

I liked where it was situated. I mostly liked being a member of this gym, however the basketball court and pool often have a waiting time.  I wished to have bigger space available on each to meet the high demand, but they only had about five lanes in the pool, one or two of which was occasionally blocked off for private lessons.  The fitness area, though, is more than sufficient enough in size, and there are numerous personal TV screens available with about 20 channels to surf through with headphone audio at many a bike or treadmill.  Some of the bikes come with instrumental music built in, or you can just dock your ipod which is what most people do. \n\nI complied correctly with their paid notice for 30 days cancellation policy, but I was still terminated earlier than expected due to an error by the membership office.  The staff here is extremely friendly and helpful and sorted out that problem I experienced, and I was soon reinstated for just the 3 remaining weeks for which I had already been under contract.  Another time I locked my keys in my own locker and one of the staff leant me a company t-shirt and a pair of flips so that I could go back to my office to retrieve my spare key.  What a great gesture!\n\nOverall, I give this place great credibility and would recommend it, with a few reservations. With the price tag of about $1,200 a year, I couldn't justify continuing to spend this kind of money. It would be a lock if I could have gotten my employer to subsidize part of it for its health benefits, or offer payroll deductions/discounts, which some area employers now do in the interest of employee health and morale.   Unfortunately, because my employer did not participate in the direct discount program, I was denied a discount even though it was available to other employees in my building whose status was full time instead of contracted.  I wish Sporting Club had made an exception for me, since the only reason I enrolled in the first place was because of my client's advertising to all employees on the site in which I was being paid. Since they wouldn't honor it, I found Sporting Club to be generally unaccommodating and I didn't stay with them after switching jobs, to a place that was willing to offer a better deal through such payroll deductions from my new employer. One other area of disappointment was when this proprietor allegedly terminated the contract of an independently run juice bar that was doing so well to make their otherwise ordinary lobby seem like a relaxing lounge.",2010-08-04,04:11:33

Actually it was reno-tastic. Sports screens everywhere, video poker, beer and fried food. \n\nThe service was quick and friendly and the chicken was fried. In fact, I think everything we had was fried except the drinks. The batter used on the chicken tenders were comparable to batter used on fish and chips. We also tried the appetizer combo which was good but a little pricey for the portion size. The Chicken Dippers that I had were good, but a pretty unseasoned. They offer dipping sauces which helps, but it was lacking in flavor (and IMHO, crispiness).\n\nMy husband had the Super Hell Fire wings, which were spicy, but he could have done with more hell fire. I guess when someone advertises something as Super Hell Fire and not Kinda Hell Fire it's a little misleading.\n\nThe only other thing they could've offered was a wing-eating challenge of some kind.

Easily accessible from Tulane University, I've spent many a happy-hour here.  The food is nothing the rave about, rather pricey for what it is, but the margaritas are darn tasty and the happy-hour price makes them more appetizing (double margarita for the price of a single margarita, $6).  \n\nMy advice to you, stop by for the happy-hour specials, nom on the free chips and salsa, enjoy the lively atmosphere, and then skedaddle your way to another bar or restaurant once the clock strikes 6:00 PM.  \n\nIf you decide to dine here, I suggest sharing the fajitas with a friend--you're served a sizable portion of meat, veggies, and fixin's to share comfortably between.  Plus, you're probably already full from that margarita and those chips and salsa you just downed.

Our bartender, Shanon ""Deuce,"" was a friendly lady who filled us in on the daily specials(try the $3.50 bluberry gin martini) and the place's history.  While nursing our drinks, pulled pork tacos and homemade slaw magically appreaded behind us.  SO GREAT.

I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.\nFor my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.\nI had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.\nChipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. \nThe ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.\nThe margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.\nThere's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. \nChipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks. It's quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at Chipotle but it has great depth of flavor.",2014-03-15,21:49:04

Overall we enjoyed the food. The manner in which it is served was maybe a little off putting but we quickly overcame it.\nThis is a restaurant that opened a couple of years ago on East Fourth Street near downtown Reno. It's in a new building in an area targeted for redevelopment by the city of Reno.\nI looked over the menu and found nothing I would object to so when it came to ordered I deferred to others. Robin pretty much handled the ordering and she did a good job. She made a point of ordering food that would be a contrast. She noted one previous dinner there where too much of the food seemed similar.\nBut because Robin did the ordering I can't really tell you much about what we ordered. We had the combination dish and we got two beef dishes and three vegetable dishes. Robin also got some cottage cheese that was a nice mix with the spicier dishes. \nWe placed our order and the food arrived a short time later. If you're not familiar with Ethiopian food it would help to look at my pictures. All five portions of food and the cottage cheese are served on a platter on a big sheet of soft bread called injera. Additionally, there is wrapped bread served in a plate. One member of our group asked, ""Are there plates?"" The answer is no. You take some of the bread on the side, tear off a bit and use it to pick up meat or vegetables. As the food gets mushed together eventually it's easier to pick it up together.\nI can't describe each individual dish, but all were good. And the cottage cheese is a nice addition, too. We didn't feel full after we finished the first so we ordered a lamb dish and it was also good. Also lots of good wine. Robin and Fred brought a nice 2010 Twisted Oak verdelho and a 2009 Dillian primitivo. I brought a 2010 Ametzoi Rubentis, a Basque rose that's a little more rounded than the 2009 I brought to the Chowdown at the Santa Fe.\nService was good.

For pizza I got pepperoni. I got the wings medium hot.\nThe strength of the pizza was the sauce. Nice flavor. A little bit of zing plus some good tomato flavors. Not enough of it, though. They seemed light on the cheese and pepperoni, too. The pepperoni was also quite tasty.\nWhat I didn't like was the crust. It's not especially thick, but it's dense. Also, it was a little doughy. I would get it crispier if I ordered it again. Because they're light on the other ingredients, the crust dominates the taste of this pizza more than pizza from other places. If you love the crust, you'll love the pizza. I don't.\nWhile the sauce was the highlight of the pizza, it was the downfall of the wings. It tasted a little sweet and had kind of a cheap barbecue sauce flavor to it. The meat used in the wings are of excellent quality, though. They don't cut corners on the quality of the meat. I think I might like these more with a better sauce. \nI got pizza here a couple of years ago and didn't find it memorable then, either.\nOther Yelp reviews indicate this is still owned by the same family.

I think people used to good Bay Area Chinese food would like them., Also the tomatoes were fresh and plentiful. They stood out and were a tasty component to the dish. The beef was tender and flavorful.\nBut the dish was absolutely drenched in sweet and sour sauce. Look at one of my photos and you can see the sauce dripping off an onion slice.

I asked he first bartender what the best thing was on the menu and he pointed to the fried calamari, so I ordered that. The calamari was cooked just right but it didn't have much flavor. The flavor mainly came from being battered and deep fried. I'm guessing maybe it wasn't the freshest calamari. \nI decided to order the Polish sausage for dinner. I got it with kettle chips. The Polish sausage was an attempt at Polish sausage. It wasn't a generic spicy sausage they called Polish sausage. But it was just okay. Nothing special. I wouldn't get it again.

Nice fresh green chile and the cheese and onions and whatever else they used to stuff it added good flavor.\nSo except for the chile relleno, it was a routine Mexican meal. I'd eat there again if I was in the area, but for me it's not worth the trip out there to eat.",2009-12-04,01:45:42

The tacos were just that good. \nThe food had gotten to be more authentic in the last 20 years. Ironically, that means it's gotten less distinctive. Jimboy's is like so many other Mexican restaurants. The food is almost as expensive as a sit down Mexican restaurant but not as good. Although the tacos, at $1.29 each, may be a dime or two cheaper. And they're bigger now, too.\nThe secret to Jimboy's tacos is the Parmesan cheese on the outside of the shell. As far as I know no place in Mexico does this. But man does it make tacos taste better, especially ground beef tacos. \nI used to live on Sullivan Lane and I was a frequent customer of this Jimboy's. The food wasn't especially authentic. The menu was limited. But the tacos were excellent. And they seemed to have plenty of Latinos for customers, an acknowledgment that the Parmesan cheese was a nice improvement.\nI moved away from the area and the Jimboy's franchise expanded. Some of the other chain locations were just wretched, but the original here on Sullivan Lane seemed to serve as a good flagship.\nI probably had not eaten here in 15 years. I had subpar dining experience at another Jimboy's and decided to try the flagship location again.\nIf it was the tacos, I'd give it four stars. That Parmesan cheese coating is distinctive and sets it apart. They've expended the menu and the dishes have gotten much more authentic, something I usually applaud. But it's chain Mexican fast food and it's not that good and kind of expensive.",2010-08-18,10:10:49

I'm giving them two stars mainly because of a bad experience. I won't  return.\nI got to China Kitchen at about 5:10 p.m. I placed my order at the counter because I wasn't sure if they had waiter service. I guess they do. I ordered the pork chop because it looked like the least Americanized thing I could find on the menu. I wanted to try different appetizers to see which they did best. Since the pork would be spicy, I knew I should have gotten a non-spicy soup to balance the meal, but I like hot-and-sour soup too much, so I ordered that.\nI paid and made it clear I wanted to eat it there (in large part so I could get good photos of the food). The younger girl who took my order said ""Here?"" and I said yes, so she waved me over to a table. There are five four-tops and two were occupied. I took the third one. The dinner rush showed up and within five minutes or so the two remaining tables were taken. Then there was what appeared to be a family of four waiting for a table.\nFinally, the young gal who took my order came out of the kitchen holding a bowl of soup. She made eye contact with me and smiled. I assumed it was my soup. Then an older woman behind the counter gestured with her hand and said something to the younger gal with the soup,. She walked back into the kitchen. I never saw a bowl of soup out of the kitchen the rest of the time I was there.\nFinally, several minutes later, the young gal came out of the kitchen with two bags of food to go. She came over and set it on my table. I explained I wanted to eat it there. ""Here?"" she asked. Yes, here, I replied. ""Here?"" she asked again? A little more assertively I said again, yes here. She seemed resigned to the fact I was going to eat there, so she started taking the food out and plating it. There was no spoon on the table and there was no spoon to go in the to-go bag either (maybe it wasn't originally done to go?) so she got a spoon from behind the counter.\nI started with the hot-and-sour soup. It was definitely off. I don't know if it was missing an ingredient or had too much of something else (maybe cornstarch). To tell you how bad the hot-and-sour soup was, they brought it in a to-go container and I left at least half of it there.\nI liked the barbecue pork skewer among the appetizers, but nothing else jumped out at me. The spring rolls and fried chicken both had what I call a refrigerator taste like they had been in the refrigerator too long.\nThe person who cooked the spicy salted pork chop showed some real talent though. Nicely spice. Probably too much salt but I still liked it. But also tender and flavorful.\nThe selection of vegetables was also disappointing. There were five choices and three of them were some variation of tofu.\nMy entree was better than the typical Chinese fast food place but China Kitchen did not fare well in too many other categories for me to return.",2014-04-15,00:29:31

The broth was perfect, maybe the best of any Chinese soup I've had in Reno. I don't recall the soup here ever having been that good before and I'll explore it, especially with the shrimp dumplings and wontons.\nI also ordered the dim sum sampler. It was a mixed lot and I actually left dim sum uneaten, which is a rarity for me. The surprise this time was the leaf-wrapped sticky rice. The leaves left a nice tea flavor this time on the rice, which I haven't tasted before, even in nice Bay Area Cantonese restaurants. But much of the rest of the dim sum was just okay.

If I had been rating this place just based on the inside experience, I would have given it three stars. However, my outside experience was pretty damned abominable. When I ate inside with my boyfriend and two friends, our experience was fairly pleasant. The place is pretty small and shabby (dare I say a little dirty?), but the service was prompt and the employees friendly. My Jerk Shrimp was not as amazing as I had expected, but still palatable to say the least. I got a pineapple soda to wash it down, and I was happy. \n\nThe outside experience, on the other hand, was quite the opposite of pleasant. The hostess was a little abrupt with us, since we questioned the $5 per-person ""entertainment fee"" and $6 PER SIX-PACK ""corkage fee"". Now please, let me define for you a corkage fee (thank you, Answer.com): A charge exacted at a restaurant for every bottle of liquor served that was not bought on the premises. The Jamaican Jerk Hut does not sell any alcohol, so this is a misleading use of the term ""corkage fee""... they aren't losing out on any alcohol sales, since they don't have a liquor license. The only thing they did that was worthy of monetary compensation was provide us with a bucket of ice. That really pissed us off. \n\nSo even before we sat down to eat and drink OUR OWN BEER, we had already shelled out $21 between three of us. (Good thing we brought another six-pack in our backpack that they didn't notice...) Let me just say that I wouldn't mind paying a $5 cover to see an act worthy of that money. However, instead of hearing authentic Jamaican music, which I was hoping for, there was a white guy with dreads who was pretty much the worst Bob Marley impostor I've ever seen. Fake Jamaican accent and everything. There isn't much that I despise more than white people faking Jamaican accents... or anyone faking any accent, for that matter, and trying seriously to get away with it. Anyway, I digress... I'll just say that the music was not up to par.\n\nWhile we were sitting there trying to endure the terrible music and forget about the through-the-roof prices, we were kind of paying attention to our mostly bland and disappointing food. It seemed like they were mass-preparing meals, except they took three times as long to come out than a mass-prepared meal would. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the coconut shrimp appetizer. The sauce was a little too sweet, but mostly good. The jerk chicken with rice and beans was kind of dry and not as spicy as I would have liked. Very, very disappointing. The fried plantains weren't even good... they were greasy. Yuck. I might give this place a try again, but it will NEVER be outside.",2009-03-04,03:08:43

The store is easy to find if you know where you're going: next to Scheels and in front of the movie theater. I stopped by after work on a weekday to try on wedding dresses. This is now my fifth store in Reno in which I've searched for a dress, which means I'm a hard sell. Most wedding dresses are just not my style and not my desired price range. I had such a fun and successful experience looking for a wedding guest gown two years ago at the old location, so I had high hopes for Boulevard of Dreams.\n\nIt should say something about me that my eyes went directly to all the beautiful, bright colored gowns on a long rack. That all the white wedding dresses are in protective cases makes sense, but it also makes it very difficult to feel compelled towards any one of them. But that maybe is because most of the wedding dresses here are quite traditional: beading, poofy skirts, huge trains, lots of stiff satin. So not me at all. But the clerk tried valiantly to help me nevertheless. She showed me the section of white formal and prom dresses and thankfully there were a few that appealed to me. My favorite was two sizes too big in the bust, and the clerk informed me that alterations are free at Boulevard of Dreams. What! A major appeal of this store is its relatively low prices, and free alterations is a very attractive offer. But I decided to pass. My most perfectly me dress awaits, somewhere!\n\nI definitely recommend this store to ladies on a budget who are shopping for a formal or prom dress and for brides who are looking for a very traditional style strapless beaded poofy wedding dress.

The exotic locale and precious few hours open make it quite difficult for me to reach, but I had read so much about this enigmatic vehicle that I waited patiently for a chance to escape the laboratory for the express purpose of discovering this fabled cuisine. \n\nDuring my first attempt, I arrived at 1:15, which is not such an unreasonable hour of the afternoon. There were approximately 5 falafel seekers ahead of me, but alas, I was told he would not be serving any more customers that day. Bollocks! My plans were foiled, and the mythical falafel had evaded me. \n\nI anxiously awaited another opportunity to seek this supposed holy grail of middle eastern food. The second time I arrived at 11:30, and was forced to wait interminably. But wait I did, suffering through fathomless prattle from the proprietor, to which I politely smiled and nodded in response. Finally, my toils (and currency) were justly rewarded with a heavy platter of delicious-smelling sustenance. \n\n- end dramatization - \n\nIt was a lot of food, but also kind of expensive at $10 a platter. As the guy said, you could pay a lot more at a restaurant for food like that. True, but this is a food truck and not a restaurant. The chicken and rice truck in New York is about half the price and twice the deliciousness. \n\nMost of it tasted good, even really good, but nothing was particularly outstanding except for maybe the grape-and-other-unidentifiable-things-salad, which was very interesting in flavor. Everything else was a little too garlicky even for my taste, and I'm the kind of person who could snort garlic powder. Also, the chicken and falafel were both too burnt, and I generally like a little charred flavor. \n\nIt may be worth noting that my friend politely asked several times if it would be possible to bring another platter back for someone else. He began to babble about a liquor license and something about drinks. I'm not sure if he legitimately doesn't have a firm grasp of the English language, or if he was consciously choosing to ignore her question by rudely changing the subject and feigning incomprehension. \n\nWas it good?

The $25 sashimi platter comes with precisely 15 small and pretty thin but artistically cut slices of 5 kinds of fish. Two were your standard salmon and tuna, and the other three were fluke, mackerel, and something like snapper or yellowtail, I don't quite remember. While the sushi here was marginally better than many less-expensive sushi restaurants, I'm not sure it was worth the price markup. For me, there's a threshold where, once sushi is reasonably good, I care more about being able to get full without breaking the bank over minute improvements in fish quality. \n\nThat being said, the sushi here is pretty tasty (especially the spicy tuna maki and the mackerel sashimi). If you want to impress someone with a fancy sushi place and spend a lot of money in the process (I would guess ~$100 per couple to get full), then this is your place (or Morimoto, I guess).

Now, I don't know if you know this, but turkey and pastrami are not the same thing. One is poultry and the other is pure, unadulterated deliciousness.

They also didn't do any glaucoma tests - no air puff or pupil dilation/blue light. While I (and probably every other person ever) detest these exams, it would have been nice to at least be offered an explanation of why neither was being done. I think maybe they were just trying to cut costs/save time. I was seen 20 minutes after my appointment time, and saw two other people go in for an eye exam before me. On the upside, their eye exams only took 5 minutes as well. If you're terrified of the more invasive eye tests and don't care if you have glaucoma or not, then sure, give them a try. Otherwise, I would go somewhere a little more thorough. \n\nThe frame selection was pretty terrible. Maybe this was partially a function of my insurance, but all the frames in the back upper level that were $130 or under probably should have actually cost about $5 each, if that. The quality was pretty crappy, most of them felt cheap, and the styles were mostly hideous. Maybe if you have an awesome insurance plan and/or can afford the fancy designer frames in the front, they wouldn't be so bad. \n\nThe kicker though, was that I only went for an exam and told them I'd hold off on getting glasses, and MAYBE come back for them another time.

The tiny dabs of fresh mozzarella were a bit pitiful, and the ""finishing with fresh basil"" was nonexistent (I believe someone else posted a picture of it on Yelp - not at all what it looks like on their website or how it is described on the online ordering sites, and ours had even tinier spots of cheese than theirs). The crust and sauce were decent though, so if you don't order this pizza, you might be okay. \n\nThe is a good place for decently-priced high-cholesterol-inducing takeout/delivery.

The ceviches were decent, the shrimp better than the tillapia, which had an interesting spicy-fruity taste. The appetizer sampler at $16 was huge, with delicious empanadas and very good tacos dorados. Their salsa is mildly spicy and tasty. The nachos were pretty good, served with a thick bean paste, melted cotija cheese, and a sprinkling of diced tomatoes.\n\nOn the downside: the tamales were a little dry (as tamales are apt to be). Some of our chips were quite stale (and strangely had gone a little soft), and the avocado we were served with the ceviche was inedibly unripe. If that's their idea of how avocado should be served, I'm afraid to try their guacamole. Also, this place is just a tad more expensive than I usually like to pay for Mexican food, as entrees averaged about $18.

You could get there an hour ahead of time and still not get a table. They need to better regulate pre-quizzo seating and direct non-quizzo patrons upstairs or downstairs. They also give one particular team unfair preferential treatment, because they're ""regulars"". However, these ""regulars"" bring their own snacks and never end up paying for their beers because they always win. Why such special treatment for some old dudes they're not making any money off of?

I understand that sometimes patrons refuse to leave, which is out of the restaurant's control, but that's something they should account for when booking reservations. Also, the hostess had kind of a nasty attitude when we inquired politely about our table after 30 minutes of waiting. She offered to send down the manager, who was apologetic and gave us complimentary margaritas and guacamole, so at least he was nice and the gesture was appreciated. One star for the nice manager who gave us free stuff. \n\nHowever, waiting 40 minutes for our table was only the beginning of a long night of waiting. Service was extremely slow and each course took forever to arrive. The waitress was pleasant enough, but didn't stop by to say something like, ""I'm sorry for the wait, your food should be out shortly."" The bussers did their job pretty well, though. \n\nThe food itself was mediocre. The guacamole was decent, but not amazing. It was comparable to the guacamole you can buy at Trader Joe's, which is good but also costs a fraction of the price. I was excited to try the ceviche appetizer, but it was unimaginative and even tasted kind of sour (in a bad way) and funky, which is not good when it comes to raw fish. This made me sad because I love both mackerel and ceviche. The braised short rib entree was good; it was probably the only thing that impressed me (this is where the other star comes from). My dining companions were not thrilled with their scallop or pork dishes, though. The desserts were not even worth mentioning, but I will anyway. The churros were dry and hard and tasted like 3-month-old stale donut sticks sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. The tres leches was bland with a weird frosting and a ""pear compote"" which was more like a few pieces of canned Del Monte diced pears.

All of the toppings fell off and it was a bit dry. \nMy entree had potential - shrimp and spinach ravioli.  The filling was good, although a bit dry but the ravioli were hard on the edges, almost crispy, they were so undercooked.

We only saw the guy who was supposed to be our waiter after at least 5 minutes, having gotten psyched out thinking he was coming to greet us, but then turned his back on us to work with the table next to us. \n\nMost seasoned diners are cool with the waiter just at least ducking in for a second with a ""Hey, I'm slammed, but I'll get water over here soon as possible"" or something along those lines, but nope, not here.\n\nSo, when front of house staff finally alerted a manager to what was going on, she took her time about getting to us and said a quick ""I'm sorry"" before making excuses about what the waiter had been doing. Didn't need excuses, the apology would have sufficed. Had it been genuine. \n\nWhen the waiter finally did personally make it to the table, he was completely vacant/ no personality/ no effort to connect at all--much like the manager. Mind blowing, considering people usually love waiting on my friend and I, since we know what a hard job it is and really try to make them feel special. No chance here, since the waiter was so absent. Literally and figuratively.\n\nMy companion and I were both bummed, as we'd been so looking forward to trying this place. I'm in no rush to go back- for food that is ok and service that showed no effort to care that we were there; I am happy to spend money elsewhere. Despite decent food, the place left a bad taste in my mouth.",2013-06-02,16:10:30

Tomo Japanese Steak House & Sushi Bar features an urban space equal to what you might encounter off a main thoroughfare in the heart of Tokyo, or a hip NYC 'hood.  Tucked into a special section of the restaurant, the hibachi (also known as teppanyaki) grills are bounded by dark glittering granite table surrounds, modern yet comfortable seating, subtle splashes of blue lighting, wrapped with distinctive architectural details on the walls. If just for the décor, go once! \nThe sushi was quite tasty and the presentation was top notch--absolutely, a work of art! It's the safe bet if you do go to check out the décor. And they offer half price sushi on Sunday afternoons, if you're still on the fence. Unfortunately, I cannot offer compliments on the teppanyaki. I gave some advice to the chef, but who knows if he really took it to heart or if I just visited on an off-day? Unlike the average Indy diner, I do not descend from a line of deer who might subsist on a salt-lick alone. I abhor overly salty food and rarely ever add it to my own cooking. How the hell an Asian joint (uh, isn't soy sauce the first ingredient of pretty much any teppanyaki dish??) came up with a bland fried rice that tasted saltless remains a mystery. The chef conceded that perhaps he'd used the sweet butter, rather than salty. If that got sorted out, I'd be willing to give it one more try. Plenty of great restaurants stumble a bit in the beginning. Before you commit to the teppanyaki, see if they'll let you sample their two dipping sauces which were also inferior to every other teppanyaki place I've ever eaten. I gave the chef feedback on that also and he said he was refining it. If that dipping sauce has been fixed, you might be brazen and give the grill a chance.",2009-11-15,23:50:20

There are far too many other great vintage shops in St. Louis that offer just as good or better quality and pricing, without the godawful crappy attitude. This was hands-down the worst experience I have ever had in a vintage store. The owner and her seamstress/ shop worker were equally rude to everyone who entered the store. I was there for about 2 hours, thoroughly looking over all the stock for sale and then also had to wait for a dressing room for awhile. \nWhen I advised the owner that one of the dresses had a hole and the zipper was stuck, she seemed affronted I would mention it: ""Well for a $32 dress, I'm not fixing it.""  I just thought she might want to know since she had a seamstress working there. Then, I picked up a pair of dress clips that had a price tag on one of the pair. When I went to pay, she said that it wasn't one price for both. This is like pricing earrings individually. And who has ever heard of someone going UP on the price at checkout? \nWhen a woman trying 60s dresses on asked if they had another dress in the same style, the owner sneered: ""You've seen everything!"" I exchanged a roll of the eyes with said tryer-on's friend. She treated everyone like a suspect and just oozed a negativity that I would defy the happy-go-luckiest of people to rise above. It's really too bad because there were a few decent pieces to be had and I was initially impressed that all items were marked with measurements, even if prices were on the high end. Pay more and get this sh*tty attitude? Uh, no thanks! \nI feel really sorry for this woman that she is so miserable.

I also like that this hotel is a re purposed historic building (opened as a bank in 1927).  But it appears the recent renovation stopped at the lobby and didn't make it to the guest rooms which was a bit of a surprise for me.\n\nMy room was located on the 6th floor and while I expect odd room configurations in renovated buildings that usually have no view (my room although it had three windows- looked out at another neighboring building) I do expect my room to feel clean.  This was not the case here as the sheer draperies on the windows looked grimy.  They should just take them down and start over.\n\nThe room also had very poor lighting.  I turned on every light in the room and it still was dark.  And I hate hotel configurations that have the sink out in the middle of the bedroom instead of in the bathroom.   The whole set up was a bit ""hodge podge"" and for $215 a night I expected more (especially given I had just stayed at the Sheraton down the block for half the price and a better room a few months ago)\n\nBut you can't beat this place for it's location and proximity to Printers Alley and Broadway.  And the free Internet, free coffee, in room refrigerators and renovated lobby are also nice.\n\nI had a drink at the bar in the main lobby and with the soaring ceilings from the historic building as well as the friendly service behind the bar, it was a nice place to start my evening.  If your drive- valet will run you about $22 a night - just pull up on the 4th street side of the hotel and the VERY friendly valet will take your car.\n\nI also loved the service that I got from the front desk staff.  Not only were they quick and efficient- they took the time to remember my name so that when I came back down to purchase some water, I was called by name . . .a nice touch but one often found in more expensive hotels.\n\nIf you like to swim- know that there is no pool at this hotel- however they do have a reciprocal agreement with it's sister hotel, The Renaissance, located a couple of blocks away so you can get your laps in there.\n\nI wanted to love this hotel, but I didn't.

Before I got there he couldn't care less about the game, now that I was there he started whispering things under his breath about the game and cheering for the other team  - I almost freaking lost it and turned around and did something that could have got me in trouble.

But sometimes, when you have kids, grandkids, a full time job, school and 25 hours worth of things to do in a 24 hour day, sometimes, it's a necessary evil.\n\nI've never been in this particular Burger King before, however, it was right near main street and we were at the New Port Richey Christmas parade with the little ones.  When a four year old starts tugging on your shirt whining ""Gramma, I gots to peeeeeee..."", you head for the nearest bathroom, no questions asked.\n\nWe were all starving any way, so hey...why not?\n\nThankfully enough, a clean bathroom and playground are the highlights here.  But, you know, it's still burger king on a Saturday night.  So, swarms of teenagers and always some inconsiderate fool who has no problem smoking in the playground in front of other peoples children.  The area is clearly marked ""no smoking"", but invariably gets ignored by the inconsiderate inhabitants getting their fast food fix on.\n\nWhile this BK is clean and nice, I feel I must minus a star because management refuses to speak up to the rude customers who insist on lighting up in the playground in front of the children and those of us who prefer clean air with our onion rings.\n\nI have nothing against smokers.  Honestly.  If you want to kill YOURSELF by smoking, that's fine.  No issue.  They're YOUR lungs, but innocent kids shouldn't have to breathe it in...and management should protect their littlest customers. It's sort of in their best interest.  Kind of hard to order food when your clientele all have oxygen masks on from lung cancer.  \n\nHowever, if you have to stop in...its not the worst place in Pasco to stop for a quickie snack.  And, let's be real...they sell Cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  2 in a package for about three bucks.

Margaritaville.  Hardrock Cafe.  NASCAR Experience.\n\nYou get my point.  \n\nBasically, any restaurant you would find along Citywalk or Pleasure Island.  Started to like them even less, once I found out that most of the ""memorabilia"" in these places are not exactly authentic, but mostly replicas. I mean, honestly?  How many of these restaurants can have Eddie Van Halen's ""original"" Frankenstein guitar or Judy Garland's ""authentic"" ruby slippers?  Cute as a novelty, but that's about it.\n\nAnd, that's what you get at the Hard Rock Casino.  A whole lot of inauthentic pieces of nostalgia hanging up all over the walls of the casino.  The casino itself has a cool vibe to it, very rock and roll, with quotes from some of the greatest singers and songs in rock history all over the walls.  However, it is hard to see them from the heavy, thick layer of smoke all over the casino.  My husband and I have been to Vegas a number of times and do our share of casino hopping.  We're not big gamblers.  Dump some change in the slots, maybe a few hands of black jack for fun.   But, nowhere, in any other casino we have visited is the air in the room absolutely unbearable and hard to breathe in!  I don't know if it is a poor ventilation system or if it is the amount of people in the place, but even a heavy smoker would find this place irritating.  \n\nAside from the rock and roll theme that really isn't more than decoration incorporated into the overall vibe of the place, there isn't a whole lot the the Casino has to offer.  The restaurant off the Casino is your standard Hard Rock fare.  Burgers, sandwiches, wraps.  The dance club is always empty.  It's labeled as an exclusive VIP club, but really, it's just a roped off area to stand around, watch women on stages dance, have really annoying dub step played by a DJ who looks so beyond bored and higher priced drinks than in the casino itself, a mere 10 feet away.  \n\nThis brings me to the Center Bar in the middle of the casino. Good luck trying to get a table or a drink for that matter.  I've seen lunch lines in middle schools move along quicker than the lines for a drink here.  The waitresses are scarce and the bartenders seem completely disinterested in the fact that you have been standing there, money in hand, tongue hanging out, slowly dying of second hand smoke inhalation and dehydration.  I also find it unusual that this casino charges for their drinks at the games.  Most casinos don't.  Also, I have NEVER seen a casino charge for soft drinks or coffee for designated drivers or those trying to sober up.  Very peculiar to me.  \n\nBecause this is the fine town of Seminole, the sign out front that says ""Dress to Impress"" as you walk in is blatantly ignored.  Why bother putting the sign there if it is okay to be ignored.  There are people in the casino who look like they just got done working on their car.  Dirty shirts, cut off shorts and baseball caps.  Then, in a really bizarro twist, you'll see women there who are SO overly dressed up that you'd swear they just walked in from their Senior Proms (even if prom was in 1974).\n\nKudos to the security staff though.  In the few minutes I was standing outside waiting for our car, I did see them turn away:\n\n1) people with questionable looking ID.\n2) those already trashed upon arrival.\n3) a girl who punched her boyfriend in the face (charming)\n4) a woman obviously in her 40's or so, but had no ID.\n5) a barefoot patron.  (god bless central florida)  \n\nIn the three times I have been there, there has always been some sort of fight.  Drink throwing, cursing, fist fights.  I NEVER see this in Vegas.  Ever.  Actually, that's not true...the ONE time I saw a fight break out in a casino in Vegas, about 50 security men, each beefier than the next, swooped in and ripped them apart carrying them off to opposite ends of the casino, never to be seen or heard from again.  Gone in LESS than sixty seconds.  \n\nThere are very few table gaming options in this casino and FAR too many penny and two cent slots of the comical and silly variety.  Match the Mermaids.  Cross the Kitties. No roulette there at all, at least not the live variety.  They have the electronic variety, but for that, you might as well just stay home and play on an online gambling site.   \n\nAnd of course, this whole unremarkable experience is topped off with a huge gift shop as you leave the casino.   Hard rock t shirts, shot glasses, teddy bears, tank tops, wallets, pins, etc.  \n\nIf you are staying in the hotel, I guess the novelty of having the casino and restaurant right downstairs if you find yourself bored at 2 am is a fun thing.  It's also a cool place to go after catching a show at the amphitheater right across the street while trying to sober up before making the drive home.  Other than that, I don't think I would find myself going out of my way to be there.",2013-03-10,19:19:29

This means that there are some good things about it and some not so great things about it.  \n\nThe First Impression:  The place is very clean, well lit reception area, the people at the front desk are friendly enough and chatty.  The rooms are clean.  Everyone is in uniforms so it is easy to identify staff from customers.  There is literature about their services in the front with a full price list and of course, whatever specials they may be pushing (literally--we'll get to that in a moment) that week.\n\nThe Annoying:   I am not good with commitment.  I don't like memberships and I REALLY dislike being pushed about having one, especially when I know my schedule, my life and how often I will or will not use something.  I don't want to sit there and discuss the benefits of membership after I have just had my massage quite honestly.  I just want to pay and go on my merry way.  I understand they have to push these memberships as part of their jobs, but I really just want to get home and unwind after a massage.  I should really only have to say ""no thank you"" once.  The weekly emails I continue to get since my one visit there with their friendly reminders to sign up do nothing more than irritate me further.  *unsubscribe*\n\nThe Dollars:  They are pricey without the membership.  Probably the most expensive massage place I have been to, short of any I have ever gotten at a resort.  This DOES make the membership worthwhile, IF you know you are definitely going to use it.  For me, it makes no sense. My closest ME studio is simply too far for me to commit to. It is near my bestie's house though, so membership makes great sense for her.\n\nThe Ambiance:  Meh.  There's nothing zen about these rooms.  They are cold, sterile looking rooms with a doctors office appearance.  Sure, there is nice music being pumped in at an adjustable volume, but that's about it.  At the place I usually go to, there is soft lighting via (fake flame for safety) candles, nice aromatherapy going on, a well decorated room with drapes hanging and interesting wall hangings.  Also, there is a fresh towel to wipe yourself off with (excess oil or sweat, whatever), a can of deodorant, a bottle of body spray to freshen up with, make up remover pads (should you have smeared your make up), tissues (some people get weepy during massages), a fresh comb to fix your hair and your own bottle of water.  Just little touches like that make the experience much nicer, but again...""chain"" massage center.  Get them in, get them sold, get them out.  LOL\n\nMy Tech:  I wish I could remember his name.  He was a nice enough kid and his massage skills weren't bad, per se.  But, we got off to a not so great start.  I am HIGHLY allergic to tree nuts including almonds.  Often, massage creams and oils contain almond extract.  As he grabbed the bottle of lotion I said, ""are you SURE there is no almond in that liquid?""  He had NO clue what I was talking about despite the fact that I filled out a very detailed form out front and must have underlined about 3 times how DEATHLY allergic I am to Almonds.  ""Why do you ask,"" he said.  I nearly hurled my naked, fat ass off the table.  Seriously, dude?  I explained about how imperative it was that he not use almond oil on me or I'd kind of, you know, DIE?  He said, I'm pretty sure it's fine...but I'll go check again.  Well, great.  Thanks.  If I wasn't tense before the massage, I sure as hell was now!  [Sidenote:  No almonds in the oils]  I have to admit, I wasn't comfortable with the fact that I felt he didn't read my intake form.  \n\nThe Massage:  The massage was just fine.  He gave a good deep tissue massage, kept me appropriately covered at all times and was very professional. Took my cue of silence and was respectful of it. Told me where on my body he was moving to next before moving to it. All the right practices.   The next day, I felt a little beat up...the sign of a good deep tissue massage.  No complaints here.\n\nOverall experience: I'm giving them 3 stars for A-OK.  1.5 was removed for the almond incident (because, you know...DEATH?)  and half a star removed because of the blandness of the facility and the 10 minute post massage membership discussion.  However, this WAS a lovely treat from my best friend and if she wants to go back there again, I will happily join her, on me this time. SHE had a very good experience with her therapist and it's closer to her home so membership for her makes sense. I may take her up on the occasional ""guest pass"" reduced rate if she joins.  I have no problem using Massage Envy again, it's just too far for me for my own membership purposes.  \n\nIt's not like they rubbed me the wrong way or anything.\n\nBa dum dum *rim shot*",2014-03-05,01:59:53

""Like"" them on Facebook! --End Brag) when we stopped into Montauro's.  We were craving italian food in the worst way and being late on a Sunday night with still an hour drive back to New Port Richey, we would be out of options by the time we'd get home.  So, onto YELP we went to find out what was yummy in the local area.  Montauro's got decent reviews so we decided to give it a go.  \n\nFinding it was a bear.  They are kind of behind a huge shopping center where you think an alley would be.  After circling the strip mall on few times, we finally found them.  No big deal.  When we came in, there was some large party going on in the back room.  We were seated up front.  Cute little place, kind of a ""pizza parlor"" feel to it, complete with some photos of Italy, a window into the kitchen, the smell of garlic and fresh bread.  We were greeted immediately by the owner who was very lovely.  Once seated, he gave us our menus.  Their menu is very limited to about 10 entrees.  However, these entrees are their specialties, the great italian standard fare that no italian restaurant should be without.  Lasagna, eggplant parm, spaghetti and meatballs, baked ziti and a few others.  We were salivating between the smell of the food and the written descriptions.\n\nBread was brought to the table with some nice warm marinara sauce.  While the bread was nice and fresh (an unexpected surprise for 8:30 pm on a Sunday night before closing) it wasn't served warm, which would have been a lot nicer.  Next up was the salad course, which was served on a plate with a breaded cutlet.  Real old Italian style.  I was so excited to see that cutlet because I was STARVING by then.  It was a nice thin cutlet that is included with your dinner entree, however, I did not know it was a veal cutlet til I bit into it.  I HATE veal. I handed over the remainder of my cutlet to my husband who scarfed it down in a swallow. I was still so hungry that I just might have sucked it up and ate it anyway, but I picked at my salad and continued to munch on bread.  No big deal because I was CRAVING some old school, home made spagehtti and meatballs!  More room for that, right?  Time to give our orders and my hubs went for the baked ziti while I exclaimed ""Spaghetti and Meatballs PLEASE!""\n\nOwner tells me, they are out of meatballs.  Out of MEATBALLS?  On a Sunday night?  The big Italian family feast night...and you're OUT OF MEATBALLS?  Surely I was in some parallel universe full of spaghetti sans meatballs and veal cutlets taunting me from every corner of the room.  ""We had a big party tonight and we just ran out"".  Nooooooooooo!  Still determined to have my pasta, I sadly said...I'll just have spaghetti then.  The owner felt bad, you could see it in his face (although, looking at his eyes, all I could think about is how good those round orbs might be covered in marinara and sitting in my spaghetti, posing as meatballs).  He said he would TRY ""scrape up"" a meatball from ""somewhere"" in the back so I could at least taste it.\n\nWell, now, I am having visions of him making a meatball out of the leftovers sitting on plates from dishes not yet washed.  I said, no, that's okay.  Just the pasta.  But, he still came out with a huge plate of spaghetti and a single, small meatball staring up at me sadly saying, I don't blame you if you don't eat me.  But, I had heard such good things about the meatballs, I ate all my spaghetti and saved the delicious meatball for last.\n\nI have to say, I was very disappointed.  First of all, the meatball was predominantly a veal ball.  I know most meatballs that are real Italian style are made with ground beef, ground veal and ground pork.  Despite my hatred of veal, I can usually stand it because of the blend of the meats masking the taste of the veal.  This meatball was just...not good.  Plus, the presentation of just one small ball of meat that was just ""scraped up"" from somewhere...I don't know.  It was just disappointing.  While the owner was VERY kind and remained completely apologetic, it still sort of ruined the dining experience for me.  I would have rather he skipped the magically appearing meatball altogether and let me just imagine what could have been than bring out this one small ball that didn't taste very good and was sort of cool in the center.  We were even charged for the full meal.  Really?  Why?\n\nI really wanted to love Montauro's based on such great reviews and the staff being so kind.  My husband was satisfied with his meal, saying it was ""good"".  Normally, he raves about an excellent meal, so I guess it was just mediocre for him as well, though he DID truly love those veal cutlets at the beginning of the meal and wished he had ordered more.  You can BYOB of wine here. Wish I had to drown my sorrows.\n\nI am hoping that this was just an off night for Montauro's.  Sadly, I will never know for sure.",2013-11-23,10:55:51

Too doughy and way too much like Pizza Hut.  Great if you like that sort of thing.  I don't.  Most New Yorkers wouldn't.  However, I will rave about one thing of theirs and one thing only...\n\nThey make the best Greek salads anywhere north of Tarpon Springs.\n\nI always order their big Greek salad whenever I am craving a salad.  For $6.49 you get a HUGE tray of fresh lettuce, banana peppers (yes, I know, not a greek salad staple, but a nice addition to throw at my husband who loves them), plenty of greek olives, some fresh green pepper, an abundance of potato salad in the middle of the veggies and loads of feta cheese.  The salads are perfect for a big lunch or with an appetizer of their very yummy mozzarella sticks for dinner.  \n\nPlus, the are close enough to my house to deliver whenever the craving strikes me, which is pretty often.  \n\nI am not crazy about their pasta, their meatballs or any of the other things that usually make for a good Italian pizza place.  But their greek salads and their antipasto (which is always lovely when we have it catered in for big dinners at my house) are very tasty.  They can do salads and fresh veggies like nobodies business.  \n\nBut, what they should be known for as an Italian restaurant...their pizzas and pastas, fall flat.  \n\nMy husband, however, swears by their garlic knots.  I'm not a fan of garlic knots at all, so I cannot agree or disagree with that assessment.  \n\nBut if you live and/or work in NPR and are craving some tasty greek salad, (they come in two sizes, small and dinner sized), then Alpha is a great place to call and have them bring it right to your front door.",2011-11-16,07:42:25

The recipe was different from what I'm used to, being from Maine (it involved green peppers), but it was quite good; I was surprised, however, that the cakes themselves were squishy and not crispy on the outside. Really don't know if this is specific to the locale, or the restaurant. They weren't bad, but I definitely prefer them more... cooked. \n\nMy friends had vegetarian pasta and a shrimp po' boy, and both reported that the food was average to good.

She's had issues with them, including a few poorly-trained employees and reservations without corresponding cars, but in general it's been worth the trouble. Until today, when Taylor, the location manager, threatened her with hundreds of dollars for towing and other fees after she exchanged a car with a flat for another and forgot to leave the keys.\n\nShe proceeded to a hospital appointment where she answered the rental company's call and promised to return the keys immediately after being released an hour later. Over the next hour, while being seen, Enterprise called four times, and (in her words) ""viciously threatened me to get back there right now with their keys"".\n\nTheir excruciatingly bad customer service got even worse once she returned to the lot. I'll let her continue: ""I was almost in tears. I was doing my best and practically running from my appt, still fresh from a treatment because I was so scared of what Enterprise were going to do. I had given them the option to pick up the keys from the hospital but I couldn't leave immediately as I was getting treatment. Their precious keys were so much more important than a customer's health. They couldn't wait one hour. It is pretty disgusting. I have never been so disappointed with customer service staff.""\n\nNeedless to say she's beyond disgusted, as am I.

We drove from the Quarter to find this place and wish we would have just gone to Voodoo or The Joint.  I ordered the two meat platter to try and get a good sampling of everything.  I ordered: brisket, baby back ribs, mac & cheese and cole slaw which came with Texas toast for $15.75.  Let's talk value first, I got three slices of brisket and three baby back ribs (remember those are the small ones!), along with a small styrofoam cup of slaw, a scoop of mac & cheese and two pieces of what looked like toasted Bunny bread (not what I'd expect from Texas Toast).  I'd expect more meat than that for starters but maybe since they were running out of everything they were skimping on things.  The meats were nothing special at all, the brisket was fatty and one hardly lukewarm and the ribs had a decent amount of meat but they were so small (and served wrapped in tinfoil).  The sides, I ordered mac & cheese and slaw and was brought potato salad and slaw.  Alicia quickly brought the correct mac & cheese and told us not to worry about the potato salad.  Lagniappe, I get to taste test something else...it wasn't that exciting either!  It was kinda like mashed potato salad and pretty bland.  The mac & cheese was oily and not very cheesy.  The slaw was ok but how can you mess it up when you have chopped cabbage and you pour in some dressing and mix it up.  Again, nothing special.\n\nThe restaurant looked like they had taken a existing restaurant and tried to quickly flip it into a BBQ joint by hanging some western looking lighting fixtures & other decor, covering the existing booths and chairs w/ some cow print material and a country satellite radio station. I google searched the address and found it used to be the Alligator Pear Cafe, just as as I expected.\n\nWe keep looking for the ultimate BBQ place and the search continues!  Even the people at the table next to us told the manager how disappointing their meal was, we never got to tell the manager our thoughts but it seems like we aren't the only ones.

I have always been curious about the good karma up on 22nd, passing it constantly when driving over to see the West Philly folks. I've never had reason to stop because I was always headed somewhere, however, when this one opening up so close to my house, it was clear I could take it in for consideration. \n\nI stopped by on a walk with my dog and bf. They let me bring the dog in- massive props. The space is really lovely. It's got great high ceilings, lots of sitting room, (but all tables and chairs like a cafeteria, no cushy seating) They are open late, which is nice, but still, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. If I leave my house and walk south instead of north, I end up at Chapterhouse, and while GK is certainly nice, I also need my beverage to be on par with the aesthetics of the place, and at least at my first visit, it was not. It burnt my mouth and was 3/4 foam and 1/4 espresso and not a latte in any form of the word. \n\nI'm sure we'll try it again and at that point, I'll give it a second chance and second review, but for right now it would be my last choice for a coffee fix.

The tacos lacked anything special and the veggie lettuce wraps were the least Mexican thing I've had in Nashville (still not sure what the side dish of ratatouille was suppose to be). If you want to play it safe, stick with the appetizers -- the queso dip and guacamole were quite good even if the housemade tortilla chips were overdone. \n\nBut with great atmosphere and a cool vibe (love the tequila exchange, like a stock exchange but way more fun!), I was willing to give 3-4 stars. And here is where I knocked them down to 2:\n\nWhile we know how to tie one on, my husband and I are currently doing an alcohol fast for health reasons. He ordered a ""tonic water with lime"" and when it came, commented to us that ""at least with the bitterness of tonic, you kinda think you're still drinking alcohol"". I tried it, and while I never drink tonic water, thought it tasted pretty gross. When he wanted a second, I asked the waitress for another ""tonic water with lime"", which we had now said three times (since we had to repeat it multiple times while ordering).\n\nNext thing we know, we are getting a bill with two vodka tonics on it. Wait, what?! So we ask her why and she says that she served him vodka tonics and lime! We told her that we were always ordering ""tonic WATER and lime"" and she knew right away that she had made a mistake. We tried to laugh it off (thankfully he's not a recovering alcoholic or something like that!!) and not make her feel too bad but then we realize that she's not going to take them off our bill!\n\nI eventually went over to ask her if they can be taken off and she said no, ""because he drank them"". So I asked to speak to her supervisor and this is where it gets really terrible. She walks over to a man and briefly says a few words to introduce me, proving that she had told him about the situation earlier as he knew the whole story already.  My guess is that she had already came to him to let him know what happened and he told her she couldn't comp the drinks. \n\nSo this guy. What a terrible representative for Cerveza Jack's. He physically dismissed me by never stopping what he was doing and never looking me in the eye and said ""he drank the drinks"". \n\n""Yes, but we didn't order them -- and if he had realized it was something else, he wouldn't have drank it,"" I replied in defense. And then with the most condescending, accusatory tone, he says with total attitude, ""so you're telling me you don't know how to taste the difference between vodka and tonic water?!"" \n\nSo now I'm in a verbal war with someone who is literally accusing me of wanting free drinks and being so pathetic that I would lie to save a measly $14. At this point, I tell the guy that we don't drink vodka -- which is true -- and no, we don't know the difference. So take it off our bill or we're not paying any of it. He storms off with a huff and a ""fine then"".\n\nI understand these downtown places deal with a lot of tourists and questionable patrons but the sad thing is, our dining table of four were all locals and beyond that, two of us there actually represent tens of millions of tourism dollars coming into Nashville each year. Hundreds of clients who come to us for specific recommendations for downtown venues to send their attendees or buy out for special events. This terrible service and $14 of calling me a liar just took Cerveza Jack's off my list of places that I would bring clients, some of whom will shepherd in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of revenue for downtown businesses. \n\nFrom a personal standpoint, my husband and I are premium tequila lovers and would have loved to come back when our alcohol fast is over to sample some of their high-end brands -- and I assure you, when we order drinks, they are far more than $7 each! But with being accused of stealing paired with the so-so food, we will think twice about ever coming back.",2017-06-25,12:05:36

I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.\n\nThe chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate.

I had called earlier in the week to make sure the reservation had gone through (we had paid via priceline). When we checked in, they asked us for a credit/debit card (we assumed to cover any additional charges), but told them we had paid via priceline. When we checked out today (2 days later), my friend had a pending charge for our stay on his account. (The woman at the counter, Dee, was very rude. She told my friend he owed for his stay and when he asked to see/keep the receipt so he could call priceline, she said no and tore it up) Since priceline had already taken the full amount out prior to our stay, the hotel is obviously trying to put one over on us.

There, we would bask in our newfound good fortune with drinks, girls and the kind of victory dancing that would cause many to believe we, ourselves, brought on the Sack of Rome in 410.  The evening's theme: ""Party Like It's The Fall of the Western Roman Empire!!""  Drop it like it's hot!\n\nOur journey concluded with a siege launched on Mojitos Rum Bar & Grill.  Immediately, I made a crazed dash to the bar, ducking and dodging loitering bar patrons like a prize fighter.  My friend showed what a true sport he was, attempting his own approach to the bar from the left side and paying no heed to its many inconveniences, mainly its congested proximity to the restroom.  The barmaid delivered to us two mojitos, which were more watered down than the Eastern Coastline during the lashing of Hurricane Irene.  My friend and I sampled a variety of mojitos on this particular evening but alas, they fell shorter than Sarah Palin's serious bid for Vice President in the 2008 election.\n\nWe did not partake of Mojitos cuisine therefore, I cannot offer an opinion.  There were a great number of individuals seated in the adjacent dining room but the greater numbers were in the outside courtyard.  As I stood under the starry sky near the fountain, my keen senses detected a restlessness in the air; a nervous energy.  As my eyes panned the crowd, I noticed a chalk board on the wall behind a band that was preparing their instruments.  The main event was Fredy Omar.  Seemingly minutes later, Fredy and his musicians erupted into a Latin groove, which shot the bar patrons forward out of their seats as if ejected from a cannon!  The courtyard turned into a feeding frenzy of uninhibited male dancers, scanning the crowd for single ladies like a shark picking up the scent of blood in the water.  Rolling, spinning and bouncing off determined dancers like Barry Sanders on a punt return, I threw down my anchor at the bar and proceeded to people-watch.\n\nThe bulk of my review lies with what I witnessed before me: The male bar patrons were scary, indeed!  Absolutely nothing deterred them, not even the word ""no"", which was typically followed up with a few choice expletives from the girls.  Beside me, a couple of men were discussing a table nearby that featured an all-girls group.  They had made up their mind that the table was quite obviously comprised of lesbians and plotted a strategy to convert them to ""the other side"".  These guys had the sexual politics of a Viking attack!  Everything about them that night was pure sex!  They must have been part rabbit.  I wonder if I should have rubbed their feet for good luck?\n\nLater in the evening, a drunk female insisted that I dance with her, literally prying my hands from the bar counter and dragging me to the courtyard.  What really disturbed me was not her disgraceful movements on the dance floor but her desire to continue dancing long after the music ceased.  I wish I had a shepherd's crook to whisk her off like the Loony Toons of old.  Throughout the course of our evening, the woman continued to paw at me, despite my aggressive attempts to steer her into a willing nearby male.  Why me??  I began to doubt that even if I engaged her as captain of a steam-propelled ironclad warship, equipped with Constantine's own heralded ""Greek fire"", that I still might not escape her evil clutches!  Luckily, a man nearby took interest and they proceeded to grind upon one another near the tables until she suddenly pushed him away, yelling ""I need space!""  If I was that guy, I'd take outer space!\n\nThe music was terrific and I commend Omar and his musical entourage for that saving grace.  Parking is a pain and the drinks are much, much less than stellar.  Come to dance and move on.",2011-11-01,21:02:57

The event was with someone I had known for some time but we never decided to take a leap into the dating realm together.  When I had first met her over a year ago, her body was of excellent conditioning and her attire absolutely flawless.  This time however, and forgive me to stating this so forwardly, she had let herself fall into a state of despair without relief that rivaled the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.  What the hell happened?!  She looked like a fullback for the Green Bay Packers squeezed into a tiny pair of pumps!  Her hair was frizzy and wild like she'd been jabbing hot electrical outlets with a fork and was wearing an extremely tight floral dress that accentuated her new girth and wrapped her up like an ancient Egyptian mummy.  There wasn't enough bourbon in Kentucky that was going to minimize that eyesore but I made the best of it and accompanied her to the event.\n\nSince the venue had not yet opened to the public and a large line had formed outside, we grabbed a drink at the nearby bar.  Now, I am definitely someone who can hold their alcohol but this warrior of a woman was something else altogether.  I think she cut through her drink in about three swigs.  I sat on my barstool watching her guzzle booze in amazement like a child at a circus watching death-defying acts, thinking to myself ""it's not possible!  No way!  The human body cannot do that!""  The way she was knocking them back, it was like throwing drinks down a well!  Thank the good Lord that shortly after we sat down, the venue opened their doors and we were allowed inside.\n\nAs we entered, my date grabbed my hand and made a mad dash to the bar for more drinks.  While she was pulling me along, I felt my hand within hers and it was horrifying, to say the least.  It felt like I was holding a large ham.  I don't mind public displays of affection but when a girl feels like she's got the strength to kill an angry lion with her bare hands, it's a bit abrasive on one's nerves.  Drink after drink she continued to pave her way through, leaving nothing behind, not even the ice, which she continued to chew so loudly, her face sounded like a rock polisher.  I was excited once the music began so that my attention could be turned toward something else instead of my Viking date.  Seriously, I was surprised she wasn't drinking out of a horn!\n\nI wish I could say that the musician was good but alas, the performance fell faster than Herman Cain's bid for the presidency.  To top it off, I found myself surrounded within a haze of bong smoke.  I kid you not, some young college students had brought an actual bong to the concert and were passing it through the crowd like a pizza at a Super Bowl party.  Struggling to watch the hippy on stage moan and howl about how the world lacks tree huggers and drum circles, my date decided to make her move.  I suddenly felt her arm snaking around my upper back.  At first, I said nothing and remained motionless, which is the correct procedure when one encounters a dangerous creature.  She proceeded to move her hand down towards my lower back and attempted to move inside my shirt.  I immediately began ducking and dodging like a prize fighter but eventually, she caught me, flung her arms around the back of my head and hung onto my neck.  Trying to support her while staying upright made me feel like I was competing in a World's Strongest Man competition.  I had to come up with an excuse to escape.  I explained to her that I needed to use the restroom and I shot away from the scene as if I had been ejected from a cannon.\n\nInside the venue's bathroom was a grisly scene!   There were drunk college students stumbling to and fro; one guy apparently passed out while standing against a urinal.  I made a dash for an empty stall and once inside, realized quickly why it was empty.  The toilet bowl was filled to the brim with feces, which seeped over the edges like French onion soup.  Also, the stall's door had no working lock and appeared as if someone had chewed it off from the inside.  Apparently, the water board had turned off the city's water supply earlier in the evening for fear of contamination from a previous event, which caused none of the venue's toilets to flush.  I struggled to relieve myself as drunks continually stumbled into the door behind me, which I held steadfastly closed with my one free hand.  Toilets had overflowed to my left and right which caused me to dance in place like Fred Astaire to avoid ruining my shoes.  \n\nWhen I finally exited the bathroom, my date grabbed me again, pulled me close to her and proceeded to attempt reaching into the front of my pants to throttle me, as if she were a Formula 1 racer, rapidly working her stick shift through the gearbox!  \n\nIt was one of the worst venues I had ever attended and quite possibly the worst date I have ever experienced.",2013-01-14,19:42:41

Thinking about staying here while checking out what the city of New Orleans has to offer?  Read the following dialogue and then choose wisely.\n\nI stayed here a couple years ago when I was still living in Uptown (St. Mary St., to be exact) because the power grid had gone down on our block and well, I'm a creature of comfort.  It was during the middle of summer and every time I took a step outside, I absolutely baked.  I felt like a chicken on a rotisserie under the heat of 1,000 suns!  I had gone for one day already without A/C at night and I wasn't about to do it again.  I began calling hotels and B&B joints in the area to see if they had power.  I happened to stumble upon the Avenue Garden Hotel who, coincidentally had power!  I quickly made a reservation for the evening, packed up my stuff and headed out.\n\nI don't remember the receptionist's name but I do recall that she was very friendly.  She gave me a key and my unit was straight down the hall and the last one on the left before the hallway curved around.  When I got in, I initially found the room acceptable, however this was just upon a glance or two.  When I started to unpack my bag for the night and really get settled, things started to jump out at me.  There was no central A/C; there was a window unit and this one in particular dripped water ALL OVER the windowsill, wall and carpet.  The windowsill looked like it had started to mold and the carpet was soaked.  Speaking of the carpet, that was a mess, too.  The carpet didn't look like it had been vacuumed in a week.  There were balls of lint and dust and hair EVERYWHERE.  Oh well, it was just for a night, I thought to myself.\n\nThe bathroom was, well, dirty, too.  The floor looked grimy and the tub had mildew/scum built up.  Not terrible but definitely noticeable.  Then, it got worse when I pulled back the covers to the bed.  There were pubic hairs EVERYWHERE!  I mean EVERYWHERE!  The sheets, the blanket, the pillows; it was like Bigfoot's 'manhood' booked the room the night previous.  Seriously, I couldn't believe the amount of hair.  Whoever slept there before had hair in places even monkeys don't.  I went back out to ask for new sheets but the receptionist wasn't there and I was exhausted.  I found another blanket in the room that hadn't been used so I put that over the bed and slept on top of it.\n\nThe next day, I went back to the house and Entergy still hadn't kicked the power back on.  So, I needed to book another night but NOT in that same room!  I went to book another reservation with the receptionist but thankfully, the room I was in had been reserved already.  They had nothing left....except The Kensington Suite.  She said it was 15 dollars or so more a night but she said it with this tone that suggested she wasn't so sure I'd go for it.  I asked her what she meant and she said ""well, let me just take you up there and show you first"".  Uh, oh.  That doesn't sound good.  First, I spent the evening in a room that Bigfoot's d*** slept in the night previous and now, I'm in for MORE excitement?\n\nShe took me outside and into the hallway adjacent to the entrance into 'Slice'.  ""Where the hell is she taking me?"", I wondered.  It was like something out of a movie where the front of a business is just a façade; a front for drug runners.  We started to climb steps and I asked for more explanation about this mysterious room.  The receptionist simply replied ""let's just say that the owner got a little carried away with the decorating....""  She wasn't kidding AT ALL.  While it was a VERY spacious room with a very large closet and a huge, modern bathroom, the bedroom was definitely not something I'd seen every day.  The bed featured about four shades of red sheets and comforters and was also shaped like a giant heart with a headboard to match.  It was raised up off the ground with a crushed red velvet bed frame that extended all the way around.  On each side of the bed were two 4 ft marble sculptures that acted as night stands.  Oh yeah, and the whole ceiling was mirrored.  Hmm, I wonder what people do in here for fun????\n\nI only stayed in the Kensington Suite for one night because the following day, my power at the house was restored.  I am awarding 3 stars to this establishment because while my first stay in the ""hairy"" bedroom was pretty terrible, the Kensington Suite was quiet, clean and very spacious.  Also, the windows overlook St. Charles Ave. and they are tinted to prevent too much heat from the sun.  I enjoyed that room.  No, I really did.  Seriously.\n\nSo, I took the average of the two nights.  It's been a while since I've been back but if I had to book again, I'd def ask for the Kensington Suite!",2011-06-17,19:54:20

I'm a man and I personally don't mind a girl OR a guy chopping at my locks, so long as they know what they are doing and have the proper tools (OMG, are those pruning shears?!  Get back, you beast! :: brandishes said individual with a stick:: ) \n\nAnyway, the inside of the joint was clean enough, although the overwhelming scent of styling chemicals placed me in an almost comatose state.  Maybe that's their trick; lure you in with a coupon and intoxicate you out with products so that you don't struggle much in the chair, as they continue to hack away.  In any case, the hostess/receptionist/whatever at the front counter upon entry was kind enough.  I had called ahead and made an appointment with one of their better styling gurus so I hung out in the waiting room until she was ready for me.\n\nThis particular stylist (not mentioning names) took me to her torture chamber near the rear of the facility, while asking me questions about my hair, in an effort to size up how much pleasure she was going to get out of having her way with my skull.  A few questions later, she's off, chopping this way and that.  In the process, she was telling me over and over how much experience she had and that those around her simply didn't have the skills she had.  As she's telling me this, I began to get this searing pain at the back of my neck.  I later got the same pain in other areas and it wasn't until I got home that I realized the pain was due to cuts she gave me with the clippers.  Good god, is it too much to ask someone with elite hair cutting skills to have a steady hand?  I like Katherin Hepburn and all but I would never have let her have a go at my hair in her later years!\n\nI figured that maybe I just got a bad crop that time around so I gave it another shot.  This time, I was seated with a young, spryly girl from Dallas (again, no names....trying to be respectful).  She had this inappropriate looking top on that resembled fishnet material and her boobs were practically spilling out onto me (as I'm writing this, I'm now wondering how many men are going to promptly make an appointment).  As she's working on my hair, she's going through all these radical motions with her body, literally placing her boobs in my face at all times.  It couldn't have just been coincidence.  She was cutting my hair from behind me and still managed to find a way to get them in my face.  How is that possible??  Plastic Woman, maybe??  Who knows??  \n\nI tried to keep my composure, as if her boobs weren't literally resting on my cheek, and start a conversation.  After a while, she backed off on using her breasts to anchor onto my body and reciprocated the chat.  However, very early into the discussion, the conversation took a grisly spiral into the underworld.  She began to speak about her private life; some guy that she was dating and that he hadn't told her that he contracted crabs.  She asked me ""who does that to someone they love?  Wouldn't you say something??""  I was horrified but then thinking to myself ""why are you telling me about this or even asking??  Further, what does it say about you that you're dating a guy with crabs??""  I steered the conversation away to something else but as she was washing my hair later in the process, she started telling me about how she was unlucky with her relationships with men, that they are always into kinky stuff.  Did she think that because I was relatively close to her age, I could relate??  Good god, if she brings up anything about a brief experimentation with a ball-gag, I am running straight out of here!\n\nLooking back on the experience, I should have left VERY early on, before she had a chance to get deeper into explanation.  I don't know why I stuck around.  I guess I was tired of fighting trying to find a good barber?  No, that's not a good enough reason to sit there, listening to an employee discuss sexual exploits and STD's.  Never again.\n\nI've since begun getting my hair cut at Stardust Salon on Magazine St., which is a much, much better outfit and I'll be posting a review of them in the days to come.

YouFit is a spin off from Planet Fitness thus the same purple and green color scheme. Joining can be painful since the membership billing is handled by a third party with no way to manage it online. They require a checking account for auto-billing which to me is a sign of a sinking business. Time will tell... As for the gym, it is primarily cardio but unlike Golds has a better set up of machines and free weights. There is no traditional elliptical machines, and they all have individual TVs which is great since the main TVs in center don't seem to work. The machines are perfect for the average user and gym rat. There is no kids club or spa/pool which is a big negative for families that workout and seniors. I've joined since day one this place has opened and till this day (4 Dec 2014) there is around 10 people to work out here. I initially liked the 24/7 hours on weekdays but I used that option only once and it is kind of boring working out at 3 am by yourself. I wish they gym opened at 6 am on the weekends.There is a studio for pending classes.

We arrived around 10:40 and there was a line all the way to the the lighthouse. Security bag checks should be done before folks enter the line to speed up the boarding process (not when boarding begins). There is the mandatory photo op with the wheel before you get on. You can check it out after you disembark. Lesson 1: if you are doing the dining come early for a good table. Some were able to reserve tables near the window--not much to see since you will finish your meal even before the boat leaves. What a disappointment in that regard. Folks should be able to cruise the river while dining and enjoy the changing views not lunch then cruise. The food was okay at best with beans, rice, veggies, catfish and a sausage. It's all you can eat....didn't see much folks going back for seconds. I took a banana and bread and made me a sandwich. The live music is good but you won't be able to hear it much with the competing noise and narration going on, and god forbid that whistle. After lunch we took a tour of the boat went to the engine room, the gift shop (has ice cream), the texas bar and then found a table and chair on the aft outside. Weather was a bit chilly and many folks just sat inside waiting for the cruise to end. Rather than pass the dock and head to the bridge where the cruise ships are the boat should make its turn earlier and save the group around 20 minutes of boredom. The staff was friendly...almost too attentive as one took my plate away (with food on it) before I was done. I went to get ice tea and came back an no food! I did not get more. At least there was lots of power outlets to charge your phone as you surf the web waiting for this to end. If you do this book the 2pm or dinner cruise.

The kids were thirsty so I looked for the waitress mid-meal to ask for more. No one to be found.

It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics, it stated, ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. \n\nNot once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. \n\nThe second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, ""no"".  I ate else where that day. \n\nWhat I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?\n\nI understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option. \n\nDisclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed.

This time he had his timing right and brought them out just as he passed the separate tickets out. Providing separate tickets is a nice touch. A shame he was spacey and hit-n-miss while serving.\n\nMy (for Brad) Ribs carry-out was tasty. The baked beans and cole slaw were both New York Deli good.

This visit on their third day open was a solid 31/2 stars. This is close enough to my home that I know I will be a regular this spring and summer once the huge patio opens. \n\nWe meet after work at the bar and pigged out on some delicious low-carb treats. \nBeing a fan of Mussels, I enjoyed how they prepared theirs with bacon, thyme and Porter. It was a nice twist. A big piece of bacon with a mussel was very tasty. \n\nMy vegetarian friends will love the Cauliflower Gratin. Fresh cauliflower, seasoning and cheese, what is not to like. I thought they cooked the cauliflower perfectly, it was soft with just enough firmness for a crunch. Miss. Norma,  would prefer that it was cooked a little more, she wanted less crunch. Either way, the flavor was a winner. \n\nThe stand out of our three dishes was the board of Charcuterie, and Artisan Cheese. \nTheir terrine became a battleground, we all loved it and wanted the last bite. A nice touch to their board, the names of the cheeses was written on a piece of paper so you knew what you were enjoying. One of the servers came over and made sure someone told us about them. I was amazed, he explained how each of them was prepared and a little history as well. Nice touch, TFT. \n\nHaving gone low-carb, I am looking forward to going back and enjoying the 12 oz. New York Strip Steak. They serve it with Roasted Mushrooms, which is so low-carb friendly. \n\nThe bartenders and servers we interacted with were friendly and professional. The bar area is open with a high ceiling which is the original tin, which makes for a loud environment. The music when you could hear it, did not fit the vibe. It was as if you were listening to, KSHE.  I will forewarn you, parking is a challenge. There is a small lot and the street. So good luck on getting prince or princess parking.",2014-03-27,12:05:44

In addition to the socks, we also were considering the Vibram Five Finger shoes. Unfortunately they did not carry the Five Finger shoes, but the sales associate was still very helpful. When we asked about the yoga socks, he told us they'd be in the yoga department. The what? Yoga has it's own department? That's impressive alone. \n\nWhat made him a stellar retail associate for me was the fact that he walked us over to the ""yoga"" department instead of doing the typical retail trick of pointing and saying ""over there"".

We found a ""manly"" two shades of Grey sock that is going to  work just fine for the beginning yoga class. \n\nThe one detail that kept them from getting a 4 star rating is their pricing.

The place is basically dead, because everyone else is saving themselves for the next night. We're staying home NYE, so this is our special dinner out. \n\nWe started out with Brussels Sprouts as a appetizer. They were flash fried with house smoked bacon, caramelized onions, lemon and toasted almonds. If momma fixed brussels sprouts like this when I was a child I would have loved them back then instead of discovering their fabulous taste in these late years of life. The smoked bacon, lemon and toasted almonds made this vegetable shine. It was a fight to see who could scoop the most up the fastest, we both loved them.\n\nWe shared two sides, Mac-n-Cheese and an additional Beef Rib. Mac-n-Cheese was good, but the Webster Groves location does it better. They had a special on Beef Ribs and they were offering additional ribs, so we took advantage. Our rib was fall off the bone tender.\n\nOur entrees were the Amish Chicken and the Pork Chop. I enjoyed the pork chop which a thick cut and was flavorful. When I cut my first bite I was concerned, I thought it was going to be tough.Then I realized it was my steak knife. It wasn't that sharp.  Once my bite was in my mouth, I realized the tenderness. As I ate my chop I didn't see my server to get a new knife, so I just dealt with it. \n\nBrad's Amish Chicken was good, but not the pieces of the bird the waiter said it would be. He was told it would be a thigh and leg and when it was served, it was an Airline Breast. It was fine that it was the breast, but Brad's favorite piece of chicken is the thighs so there was a little bit of disappointment. \n\nThe CWE Block was just, A-OK.

It also grossed me out that I could see the yucky bumps on the chicken skin. I'm not sure, but I think they were just tossed in Frank's Hot Sauce and that was it. The Blu Cheese they served as a side, was thin and soupy. Two strikes, and we have only had our wings. \n\nThe burgers were 5 oz of over cooked beef. When we placed our order, the server started to leave the table and Brad stopped him and asked if he wanted to know the temps for them. He said don't worry they'll be fine, we wont over cook'em. Really? \nOur burgers were served well - well done. It was like eating the leather sole of your shoe. When ordering, I did not realize they top all burgers with grilled onions and bacon. I pushed mine aside, the bacon was hard and cold.\n\nSide dishes were equally as bad as the burgers and wings. My side was their House specialty Mac - n - Cheese. How they can call this rendition a ""specialty"" is beyond me. I took one bite and sit it aside. Brad took a bite and said he could not understand how a cook could taste this and say it is good to go, it tasted that heinous. Brad's side was Tater-Tots, it is kinda hard to screw up Tater Tots, but Sonic does a better job. \n\nThe service was minimal, the two men working were more interested in watching the hockey game on the TV behind the bar.

I had no idea I was going to discover so many new restaurants when I bought these cards.\n\nThis adventure took us down to Soulard to visit a gin joint, Nadine's Gin Joint.  We stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday so it was kind of slow, only a few other tables out on the patio and us on the inside. When using a Taste Card, I always let the server know up front during the meet & greet. I feel it is only fair that they know we are using a coupon. Like most Taste Cards Nadine's offer is $10 off of $30, no booze. \n\nWe started out by enjoying an order of Blackened Chicken Nachos. It was a nice twist to the traditional ground beef nachos. It had large pieces of blackened chicken, Monterrey jack cheese sauce, tomatoes and chives over corn tortilla chips. I would of liked some jalapenos tossed in the cheese sauce for an extra kick. \n\nNormally we order different entrees, but today we both were craving a burger.  I ordered the traditional cheeseburger with pepper jack cheese and the bf enjoyed a Chorizo Burger. The Chorizo burger was suppose to be a mix of chorizo and ground beef, but you could barely taste the Chorizo. His came with pepper jack, red onion & mayo and he requested tomato and lettuce as well. When our burgers arrived, they forgot the additional garnishes. \n\nThe burgers were hand pressed, meaty and juicy. Both were grilled to our medium rare request. I was happy with my simple cheese only burger and the hand cut french fries. I liked that the fries were extra crispy and we didn't have to request them that way.

I went to Brunch on April 15th and was to sit at one of the hightop tables in the front window. When I called to make my reservation, Tori the dining room manager answered the phone and was very perky and pleasant. She asked me if the hightop would be acceptable and I responded, yes. When she asked for my name, I admit I did use an alias. I figured they'd be on the alert for a Steven and I did not  want special treatment. Once I gave my name, she commented that she thought I had been there before, but I said ""no this will be my first"". (I think they knew it was me)\n\nWhen I arrived that Sunday morning, I was seated at the hightop close to the hostess stand. It was comfortable and I had great light for reading, since I was dining alone. \nI love a Bloody Mary at Brunch, HWK calls them a Bloody Wilbur. Their twist has; Bacon Vodka with tomato juice and garnished with pickled asparagus.  I was famished, so I ordered two entrees; Biscuits and Gravy and Eggs Benedict. \n\nAfter I place my order, John the husband of Cassy approached my table and asked me if I were the Steven from Yelp. Yes, I was busted and I wasn't surprised.  Part of being a good Yelper is taking ownership of your reviews, so with a smile I acknowledged who I was. Our conversation was very pleasant and as Cassy (his wife and executive chef) said to me in private messaging they are thankful I brought the single seating to their attention and apologetic my previous experience. \n\nNow let's talk food, after all that is what restaurant reviews are all about.  I'll break it down item for item. \n\nBloody Wilbur: Love the bacon vodka, proving everything is better with bacon. I also enjoyed the the garnish of pickled asparagus. Asparagus is my all-time favorite vegetable so adding it to a brunch cocktail, is A-Okay in my book. Their choice of tomato juice, held this drink back from being spectacular. The juice was weak, a rich and thicker type tomato juice have made this classic brunch cocktail truly pop. \n\nBiscuits and Gravy: They made this old farm boy proud. These truly were some kick ass, B&G. A picture is suppose to be worth a 1000 words, but B&G do not photograph well. So let me tell you the best I can. When you have buttermilk biscuits with chives and cheddar topped with gravy containing huge chunks of sausage - it does not get any better. These Biscuits and Gravy will be added to my Yelp list of Best B&G. \n\nMimosa: Meyer Lemon is a staple in my kitchen/bar at home. So when I saw that they use it for their mimosa, I was already sold. I found the the sparkling wine served with the Meyer Lemon and honey to be a refreshing twist to traditional Mimosa. Two thumbs up and remember I am dining alone. \n\nEggs Benedict: No English Muffin, they use a Grits Cake instead which gives an original twist. I'm not a fan of grits and I enjoyed the difference in texture and flavor. The eggs were poached perfectly and the use of Tasso gives it a Cajun kick. They then top it off with a Spicy Hollandaise and Flash Fried Spinach. \n\nI'm glad I finally got to experience HWK and I'll be back for a lunch soon. My rating is more of a 3 1/2 Star (wish Yelp would let us do 1/2's soon). If Wilbur would have been bloody better, it would of been a 4.",2012-04-21,17:43:23

I now get to check off one of my Yelp bookmarks, as experience accomplished. Oh, what a feeling. \n\nIt may have taken me years to get here and I am glad I finally made it. Black Thorn Pub serves up a decent Chicago Style Pizza,  by Saint Louis standards, so it still has room for improvement. I absolutely loved the tomato sauce with its strong peppery bite. The crust was a lite golden brown, crispy on the bottom and edges, no burnt areas, making for a perfect crust.  The cheese not being provel gave them bonus points, but the excessive amount  of cheese took them away.  I thought the day would never come that I'd hear myself saying, ""Too much cheese"".\n\nWe selected four toppings; sausage, mushroom, black olives and onion.  The black olives were plentiful and the mushrooms were fresh and thinly sliced. So thin, I could almost read The Riverfront Times through one. The bulk sausage, was nothing to write home about, so I'll say nothing about it here either. The onions, are another story worthy of their own paragraph. \n\nOur pizza did not have onions on it. Did we notice the fact that they were missing? No. Did we complain? No, we didn't know they were missing. As we sat there eating, drinking beer, discussing the ambiance and flavor of  our pie, the bartender walked up with a pizza box and said, ""here's your pizza"".  I guess the looks on our faces, asked our question, ""thought we were eating our pizza?"" Because she quickly explained how someone else ordered the same thing, minus onions and that was the one we were enjoying. Amazed we were being given ""our"" pizza, I asked ""what about the other people"". She assured me they were rushing their pizza through by preparing it in the hottest spot in the oven. Hope they got at least a free beer, we got a free pizza. \n\nWe didn't even finish the pizza we were eating and now we had another medium deep dish pizza.  What we going to do with this one? We already had our fill of BT. Driving home we came up with an idea and quickly called one of our neighbors and informed them we were on our way bearing gifts. When we arrived and handed him the box, he was shocked at the weight. I opened the lid to show him the pie and he went bug eyed. He said, he'd be eating off that pizza for two days. He too, had never been to Black Thorn. \n\nBlack Thorn is good, but not the greatness everyone sings. I love me a dive bar, but this place could use some TLC or a good power hose. The staff is friendly and can spot a first timer easily.  However, I think a bus boy/pizza runner would be a great addition to their staff. It would keep the tables clean and the delivery of pizzas straight. Having folks order and getting drinks at the bar is fine, just adding a food runner would improve the customer service and cleanliness.\n\n$45 for a medium deep dish and 3 beers seemed high to me, but I'll return for a carry out order in the future.",2013-05-05,20:18:16

When she returned, I ordered a Schlafly Pale Ale and Brad had a Ice Tea. We also, requested glasses of water. I ordered the Bison Burger and Brad had his usual, Dad's Green Chile Cheeseburger. \n\nWhen our Fried Pickles arrived they were good, but not as good as the Clayton location. The breading and the Tzatiki sauce here were rather bland.  My Bison Burger was ordered medium, and came out well done. There was no pink at all, which is not a good thing for Bison. To my surprise, it was still flavorful and tender. When I saw that it was well done, I was so afraid it was going to be dried out. Dad's Green Chilies Cheeseburger, was as good as the Clayton location. In fact, Dad's is most likely one of the best burgers in STL.  Angus beef, Crispy New Mexico Hatch Chillies and Green Chile Mayonnaise is a perfect burger. \n\nA large basket of Natural Cut Idaho Russet Fries is the right size for two to share. No ketchup bottle here, it's my favorite ""Cup of Ketchup"".

We tell him which brand of mattress we like, and ask if he has anything comparable.  He said, ""Oh, you must have come from Mattress Gallery.  Just tell me, like...what did they say about us?  We have a lot of customers that come over and tell me that they're bashing us.""  Strike 1.  (FYI - they didn't say anything.)  Then he said, ""Well, why do you like Englander?""   I said it was comfortable, plus they use it at nice hotels like the Ritz, so it's gotta be good.  He said, ""Ugh, they told you that?  That's a lie.""  And proceeded to waste 10 minutes of my husbands and my time googling The Ritz Carlton to find out which brand of mattress they use.   My bad, it was the Waldorf Astoria.  Strike 2.  Then, he saw us growing more and more uncomfortable, so he goes on a rant about how he's good at what he does, he's the owner / manager and can guarantee his lights will be on - but he can't say the same about them, and if we bring back a business card from the other store, he'll give us 40% off.  Ew.  Strike 3 and beyond.  \n\nOn top of this guys heinous behavior and complete unprofessionalism, the mattresses weren't all the great.  They didn't compare to the one we ended up getting at Mattress Gallery, that's for sure.  And the prices were WAY better at Gallery, too.

They did the work in about 30 minutes or less, I got a call as they had called her to talk about all the things wrong with the car.\n\nThey wanted to replace the cabin air filter for $88, the battery for $99, and the front brakes for $288.  I told them no and got the car.  \n\nChecked the front brakes out and they're so so, but on the so so side of keep using them a while longer till they reach halflife.  Plus a quick google showed me the average cost for the brake job was around $80 (or 200 dollars less)\n\nThe battery, it was, I think, $20 more than Auto Zone.  It's still starting in near freezing weather so we'll run it until we're having to use the jumper battery and then replace it.  It's been testing bad for the past 2 years I think.\n\nAnd my favorite - the $88 cabin air filter.  Since you probably will not believe the amount of time you can do this in, let's just say spend 3 minutes and watch on Youtube how to change a cabin air filter on your Honda.  I promptly ordered 2 filters for $12 off the net.  If you know what you are doing you can replace it using no tools in 22 seconds.  If you don't know what you are doing you can replace it in about a minute and a half.\n\nSo, typical dealership screwing its customers in the repair department.\n\nThe sales, I don't know.  It seems odd to me that with a couple of different salesmen over the years the same thing always happens - the car I'm looking at is not on any sort of financing special but they do not know it for a day because their computers are down.  There's always something wrong on their certified cars that I catch that evidently the certification department doesn't, and the key is always missing.  I just start feeling like it's part of a game, or an indication that something is really messed up with their key handling and computer systems.\n\nSo, meh, it annoys me because they're doing typical dealership stuff that would never make me want to deal with them",2010-10-29,21:21:54

I had a tartare kind of appetizer with tuna and snail?, which was tasty.. for snails. It was well seasoned and fresh. My main course was beef shortrib, which was extremely tasty, but the entire dish was one dimensional and I was craving for something fresh to cut through the richness. The greens and sides they gave were also pathetic in portion size. Dessert, if I remember correctly, were financiers, which were dry, crumbly, and not tasty at all.\n\nThis place is gorgeous (awesome view of the city), and their alcoholic drinks are superb, but their food leaves you wondering whether or not it was worth your money.",2013-03-01,22:08:47

I noticed it was BYO so we picked up a bottle of wine, which made us a little late for our 8:30 PM reservation. Fortunately, we were still seated relatively quickly, although our being seated was very awkward. The hostess led us to a half cleaned table and made us wait as we watched them clear it up. She also left the menus on the sushi bar which was a few feet away from our table, so when we were finally seated, we had to go grab the menus ourselves. The restaurant was pretty full, as almost every single table was seated. So perhaps service was backed up for this reason?\n\nAnyway, it was a while before anyone came by to offer us water, at which point we asked for our wine to be uncorked. They came back soon after, with our uncorked wine (sans ice bucket...) and 2 glasses of water, one of which they spilled ALL over me. My shirt, from my stomach area, down to my knees was drenched. The waiter seemed horrified, apologized, but then started tending to the water on the floor while I sat in shock, just sitting in a puddle of tap water. No help was offered to dry me off. I was not a happy camper at all. If I had not had a Groupon, I would have left immediately. I had a change of clothes in the car, which we parked just in front (lucky parking!), so it was fine. I'm not really that mad that they spilled water on me, because it gets worse.\n\nWhen I got back from my change of clothes, my seat was haphazardly dried and some napkins were left on the table. We sat, and resumed examining the menu. We asked for an ice bucket, which came pretty late. Another waitress came by soon after to apologize for the mishap, and offered us a discount. She then URGED us to order another special roll (which I was originally reluctant to do, because we had already ordered so much), and then assured us that the discount would cut down the price enough that our Groupon would be enough to cover the entire bill. I think perhaps that the services' lack of English skills may have contributed to this miscommunication, because at the end of our meal, they gave us a complimentary red bean mochi ice cream and they called THAT our 'discount'. When we received the bill, there was no actual discount.\n\nI was FURIOUS. We had ordered an extra special roll because the waitress had assured us that it would be taken care of with the discount, but found that there was no actual discount. We called a waiter to straighten out the issue, but the only excuse I got was that the machine wouldn't allow more than one discount per bill, and Groupon is apparently a discount. I'm still outraged at this. I had told them from the very beginning that I had a Groupon, yet they still assured me that they would have a discount, and then PUSHED us to order an extra roll.\n\nEven with that whole situation aside, the service is still pretty lacking. It was pretty slow and hard to communicate with. We weren't given a single waiter (instead the waiters chaotically came by without reason or rhyme to check on us), yet this restaurant seems high class enough to have a systematic waiting system.\n\n\nThe reason I didn't rate this place 1 star is the food. The 'normal' rolls were fresh, delicious. The hamachi-scallion roll was delightful and the scallion came through perfectly. There was a little too much crunch and grease for me in the cooked scallop roll, but it was still delicious. I highly recommend the Odessa roll, which is salmon wrapped around unagi, tuna, and masago. I didn't get too much of the masago, and perhaps there was a little too much eel sauce on top, but it was heavenly. The other special we ordered (that we were CONNED into ordering in my opinion) was the Long Island roll, which is eel tempura, spicy salmon wrapped with white tuna. That is the exact description of the roll on the menu, yet when it came out, it was covered in this overly sweet, sweet and sour chicken reminiscent sauce. It ruined the roll in my opinion, and had I known that the roll came in this sauce, I would not have ordered it. I would stay away from the Long Island if you actually like the taste of sushi.\n\n-------\nSorry for the wall of text! \n\nIN SHORT: If the service and management here gets a HUGE make over, this would definitely be one of my regular BYO's in the city. As is, I am hesitant to return. Perhaps I will get take out for the Odessa roll, about which I wil have dreams forever.\n\nCome here for good food and terrible service.",2013-05-04,16:45:26

When I saw that the place served Taiwanese off the menu, I was still hesitant about eating here, but was more intrigued by trying out Taiwanese.\n\nWe walked into the place and it looked like a typical Asian restaurant.  The decor was horrible.  It least it was clean.  The lady greeted us warmly.  When I told her that I wanted to try Taiwanese food, she appeared very hesitant about serving it.  I pushed and pushed for her to tell me what she offers.  After asking me how I knew she offered Taiwanese food, she explained that the restaurant is a pizza and salad buffet and the only reason why she offer it is because the Taiwanese students begged her.  I wanted to order the beef noodle soup and the fried pork chop dish.  She discourage because it is a lot of food.  I settle for the beef soup.\n\nThe bowl came out and it looked like Vietnamese oxtail soup.  The broth is so dark it is almost a black color.  It smelled very similar to pho.  The broth wasn't hot enough for my liking but it didn't take away from the soup.  The broth had hints of star anise and cloves.  This soup is served with a flour based noodle and pickled mustard leaves.\n\nI will have to come back for the pork chop and braised pork and rice.",2014-03-14,19:27:36

We specifically called Franco's for a pizza because as I go through all the pizzeria's in my town I'm discovering that their pies all suck. So after reading people's reviews here on Yelp, we decided to try them out. We figured they couldn't be worse that any other we've had. Well there was potential for it to be good, but I will never know now.\n\nLet me start from beginning. We called them up, gave them our order, asked if we could pay by credit card (they said yes), they got our address and phone number from us and said it'd be 45 minutes. Now this was Thursday so I though it odd to take so long for one pie, but it was the day before New Year's Eve so maybe they were busy. They hung up and we waited. And we waited. And we waited some more. About a hour and fifteen minutes after placing our order we decided to call and see what's up. The girl on the phone told us it was out with the delivery kid, and that there were other orders before ours that he was delivering too. Okay... Now this is the part where I tell you that Franco's is 0.2 miles from my apartment. That's right, less than half a mile away...\n\nNow we're going on TWO hours and the kid calls up and says he can't find us. We couldn't have explained it any clearer, honestly, it's not a big downtown area, you can't miss us. So finally he shows up at our door with a cold pizza and asks for the money. We tell him we asked if we could pay by cc and they had said yes, so we didn't have any money on us. He told us to call them and pay, and so we did. We schmucks paid for the large cold, two hour old pie (that we should never have been charged for), told them how ridiculously long it took to get it (they didn't care), and vowed from then on, never, NEVER I say, order from Franco's Place again.

Unfortunately, I don't think it was worth the wait.  \n\nFor starters, the restaurant did not seem able to handle the maybe 90% capacity they had seated.  Even though there were open tables (that were never filled), we had a 30 minutes wait.  I went to the bar and got a glass of wine and sodas for the kids ($11) while we waited and looked at the menu.  Usually prices in the mid teens and twenties don't stress me out too bad, but this place is claustrophobically small, maybe 30 years old (complete with the original decor), and looking at the menu was not impressive at all.  Pasta dishes ranged from $8.95 for (2) meatballs to $12.95 for lasagna. Not such a big deal, but the specialty dishes - that actually came with a salad and side - were between $17 and $25.  I quickly realized that it would be hard to escape without accruing a $50 bill.  Again, not a big deal if the experience is worthwhile, but this clearly wasn't.\n\nOnce we were finally were seated, the service was very quick. Of course, given that we were right in front of the swinging kitchen door (from which I continually whiffed cigarette smoke), I would hope so.  The dinner salad I ordered came immediately, but it was swimming in dressing.  On the side, crackers.  The eggplant parmesan was crispy and not too greasy, although the portion was super small and the marinara was too sweet and unnaturally red.  Once I added crushed red pepper and salt and pepper, it was palatable.  The italian sausage was covered in the same sweet sauce, and the sausage was all about fennel- not my fave at all.  The meatballs were also a one note wonder--oregano city--and smothered in the same sauce.  The pasta portions with the sausage and meatball plates was significantly more substantial than that for the eggplant parm- another disappointment, given that the latter dish was the most expensive of the three.\n\nI doubt I'll be going back.

I've driven past this restaurant along 82nd Street scores of times, and always wondered ""Why the heck did they build a Joe's Crab Shack there?""   It's not actually on 82nd St, but Dean Rd.   And you can barely see the sign from 82nd St.   It just seemed like a bad business decision.\n\nHowever, once you step inside, you see why it's there.   It's located on a very scenic lake (Lake Clearwater).  This enables them to build a huge outdoor patio with very pretty sunset views.\n\nWhen the weather warms up and the craving for crab hits again, we will definitely be returning to sit outside.",2013-05-13,16:41:21

Don't.\n\nThis place was shady from the moment we stepped in, to the (multiple) times we walked out. To *try* to make a long story short, we were trading a car in for a new one. While we were out examining the car we were going to buy, they ran the Carfax report on the car we were trading. The man that was working with us took us back to his office, and seemed distraught, and explained he couldn't give us the deal he previously offered after seeing the Carfax - apparently the car had a salvaged title, and had all these accidents and stuff. This was news to us, as we had owned the car for the past few years and hadn't known any of this. After going over it ourselves, and matching up the dates and apparent accident information, we insisted  this was the wrong car, none of the dates matched up to when we already owned it, there were wrong cities on it - we just knew it wasn't our car. The guy insisted it was, but we made him put in the VIN again, to get a new report. Sure enough, the entire time, he had the wrong Carfax - even though he was absolutely adamant it was the correct one, that there was no way he had fat-fingered the VIN. We should have walked away after that, but we didn't.\n\nEvery single thing we tried to negotiate on, he had to go back to his manager and see if it was okay. Every time, he came back and insisted they couldn't go any lower, etc. Again, we should have walked away - but we really wanted this particular car, so we eventually ended up making a deal. Part of the deal was to get some things fixed there - but every time we went to drop the car off, there was lots of confusion about who was paying for the repair, what was being repaired - it was just a huge clusterfuck every time we went in over the course of two weeks. When we would walk in, the front desk wouldn't even greet us (not sure if it was us, or everyone - they all seemed too preoccupied playing on their phones).\n\nComparing Don Brown Chevrolet to other dealerships we have been in and bought cars from, this place was just a total disaster. They definitely have the vibe of the typical car salesmen - shady and untrustworthy. There are much better dealerships to spend your afternoon at, definitely pass on this one if you're looking for a car or need service done.",2012-08-07,12:56:39

He dropped off some water and said he'd be right back.  My friend said, 'I have a quick question for you...'   the waiter cut him off mid-sentence and replied 'You'll have to wait, I'll be back'.  It was then we considered leaving.  (By the way, the quick question was if root beer on tap was alcoholic or not.)  Instead, we waited a good ten more minutes for our waiter to return, while watching him cheerily chit-chat with a table outside.  The rest of our service was just as horrible.  After our initial round of drinks, we couldn't get anyone to stop by long enough to order more.\n\nThe only reason they got two stars is because the food was still decent and a waitress in training noticed we were being ignored and saved the day.

The corn and cheese grits were also good, but I don't think they were as good as Zea's corn grits!  The fries were addicting; it must have been that Tony Chachere's seasoning!

The dish consists of grilled shrimp on top of a bed of angel hair pasta with a garlic-butter sauce. BLAHH.  I stopped dining here because of another horrific entree I ate years ago.  Olive Garden's only saving grace?  I really like the stuffed mushrooms appetizer and the calamari was decent.  The Zeppoli we had for dessert was also a big hit with the table.  They're basically beignets but with the actual grains of sugar instead of powdered with a chocolate dipping sauce.  The menu says it's supposed to be powdered, but I think I would know powdered sugar if I saw it, and it was definitely not!\n\nThough the food was lacking, our waittress was full of energy and attentive; we loved her!  She was so nice and made the experience a lot better than it would have been.  The time it took for our dessert and entrees to come out was a little longer than expected but not terribly long.  The pricing of the food is rather inexpensive, so yes another plus.  \n\nWould I come here again?  Only if I have to.  I would've given it 2 stars, but added the extra because of our waittress.",2012-01-03,03:37:19

After figuring out how to eat the drumstick and removing 1/2 the batter, the chicken was Ok. The flavor, of course, is in soaked into the breading. The Spicy was hot with a good wing burn. Even the Traditional had a tiny kick with the Sweet and Spicy not worth mentioning.\n\nWe determined the Wednesday ""Wing"" Special was fair at $5/lb but no way worth the usual $8.95. We did enjoy the Single Visit salad bar with real bacon bits even for the full price of $5.95 as the ""wings"" are not considered an entrée rating the $3.95 price.

So I'm looking at parking and there's more options at The Habit even if it does fill up at lunch. \n\nAtmosphere\nThis too is not a strong point between the two. Cal Taco is sterile with no character and very limited seating inside with better seating options outside. The Habit's backdrop is Old Town Goleta with only cramped, outside seating. No winner in this category. \n\nBefore I get to a taste test, lets discuss the bottom line.\nBurger comparison, dollar for dollar, Cal Taco/Habit (2015/05)\nSingle              $3.50/$2.95 (CT increase of 18.64%)\nDouble             $4.50/$3.95 (CT increase of 13.92%)\nCheese            $0.50/$0.50 TIE\nSingle Combo  $6.95/$5.95 (CT increase of 16.81%)\nDouble Combo $7.95/$6.95 (CT increase of 12.58%)\n\nTaste\nCal-Taco adds fresh lettuce, tomato and onion on a cheap bun but there does not seem to be any seasoning in the charpatty. It is juicy and drips down your arm so that's a good sign. There's just not much taste to it. The fries are good. I like a larger fry and these fit the bill.\n\nMy final thoughts on Cal-Taco is they are no way a substitute for the highly regarded Habit by price alone. Toss in that I feel there's less seasoning in the meat here, I'll give it a solid 2 where the description fully fits, ""I've experienced better.""\nIf you need a quick fix from a mediocre burger and are West of Los Carneros Road, it will be easier to hit up Cal-Taco. But is your happiness worth it? I think not.",2015-05-21,22:01:04

I admit to being a bit of an atmosphere snob most of the time, and this place wasn't on my radar - I actually never heard of it until they texted me the name and address that night.\n\nThis place is big.  It has a downstairs restaurant area and then a bar upstairs.  It was a Saturday night and they had a live blues band playing, which was actually good.  Nonetheless I was there to talk talk talk with friends of mine who I haven't seen in ages, so I got out of the room where the band was playing as quickly as possible and moved into the lounge upstairs so I could speak to my friends without shouting in their ears.   \n\nThe lounge is cool looking - it feels like you are at the house of a stylish friend with the comfy couches, chairs, fireplace and TV.  I liked the look of it.  \n\nI was sticking to wine that night and it did seem pricey at $11 per glass.  I don't mind paying fancy wine prices at fancy places, but in my opinion, the prices shouldn't get into the double digits at a casual establishment such as this.  \n\nThe staff seemed clueless to me.  We asked one of the bouncers if we could move one of the chairs and he just stared at us blankly and didn't answer.  We took this as a yes, and moved the chair.  I don't think they hire Mensa members there. \n\nAt the end of the night I decided to order a snack.  After looking at the menu I ordered some fries.  EIGHT DOLLAR FRENCH FRIES.  I questioned the bar tender to see if this price was correct.  He went on and on about how they used fresh potatoes and 3 delicious sauces, etc.  They arrived and were....okay.  Not even really okay, just really subpar.  And the sauces...one of these ""special sauces"" was vinegar.  Haha - special.

It was definitely homemade with chunks of pumpkins and other vegetables.  I felt like it was very healthy.  After that I got the curry potato roti.

The spring rolls were delicious - I found it interesting that they used chicken instead of pork or shrimp as is typically the case. The rice paper was fresh and so was the vermicelli.

My sister and I decided to head downtown for lunch to check it out. We always have a hard time deciding where to go but it was easy to decide this time!\n\nWe walked in and asked to sit upstairs - we agree with Erin that the communal table isn't our thing. We immediately noticed that it was FREEZING. Both of us were wearing pants and fleeces. Since it's a huge open space, we knew asking for some heat wouldn't help. Our waitress came right away and got us waters. I ordered the root beer on tap, only to be told that there isn't any root beer on tap. Hm, ok. For such a new place with new menus, that was surprising. I hope they get it in the future. There is a HUGE list of bottled sodas, really interesting ones. I didn't get one though, decided to stick with water. \n\nI ordered the veggie burger with fries and the regular ketchup, plus the creamy slaw. I asked if the slaw had onions because I don't like them and they make me sick. The waitress said she was pretty sure that it didn't but she'd check. Our food came out very quickly. The first thing I noticed was all the onions in the slaw. The second was that the veggie burger patty looked very different from any I've seen. The waitress told us it had beans, nuts, veggies... but it was pretty plain looking, no veggies apparent. I scraped the slaw off the burger and took a bite. The patty was mushy, room temp, and tasted like smashed beans with no seasoning and not even grilled. I tried the fries. They were good. The ketchup was ok - but from the bottle would've been fine. If you like a lot of sauce, this can get pricey. My sister and I each took another bite and just looked at each other. Gross. It was not at all good. In fact, it was pretty inedible. The waitress came by and we told her that we really didn't care for it, that it didn't taste like anything but mashed pinto beans and wasn't warm. She said she'd get the manager. We waited and waited and waited. And waited. No manager. Finally, our waitress came back and said they were taking the burgers off our bill. We were a little disappointed that the manager didn't come around. We really wanted to give our feedback about the burger and give advice on how to improve, as we want them to do well but vegetarians would NOT like this burger at all. \n\nI had some ice cream because I was pretty starving still, and it was decent. The mint tasted good but the chocolate chunks were huge and overwhelmed it. And the cookie dough was creamy and good but there wasn't very much cookie dough in it.\n\nWe walked out feeling disappointed. I hope that the owner/chef see this and take that veggie burger off the menu. It really brought the menu down. Rework it, try some other places, and give it some seasoning, veggies and cook it and I might try it again.",2011-10-29,20:53:34

I got a box AND postage at another location one day, but I didn't have tape for my box, so I took it home. Went to drop it off after work. Walked in and there was no place for me to drop the box since it was too big for the mail slot. The workers were still there - it was closed but they were still there chatting. I asked if I could give them my box to put in the mail - as it was stamped, sealed, and just literally needed to be put in the bin- and they said NO!

You never know when someone slips meat broth in. \n\nI ordered the mac n' cheese soup. It basically was mac n' cheese with a little more liquidy broth. It tasted pretty good.

The cheese quesadilla had a weird kind of cheese, almost gummy. Way too much. No flavor. I couldn't even eat it - and who messes up a cheese quesadilla? A friend tried it and agreed on the cheese being weird. He even said it tasted like provel! THE HORROR!!!

There were a lot of factors that conflicted between good and bad for me. We decided to go after dinner for drinks and dessert to celebrate a birthday. \n\nAtmosphere:\nPros:  Really eye catching, funky and interesting. Cool bathrooms. Some booths have curtains around them that are pulled back, but give a little semblance of privacy. It seemed loud when we walked in, but in our booth I didn't notice it.\nCons: The booths were SUPER stuffy. It was really hot in there. So much that we wanted to leave quickly after finishing. One friend commented that maybe it's to make you order more drinks or ice cream? I don't know, but the ventilation was bad where we were sitting.\n\nFood & Drink:\nPros: Ice cream was great. HUGE amount of selections on food & drink both! And desserts - omg. We had to study the menu for awhile to choose. One of the members of our party loved his espresso martini so much that he used a straw to suck the foam up.\nCons: My fiance and my drinks (French Kiss) were mixed so strongly that they were hard to drink. Overpowering alcohol and little flavor. I probably should've sent it back. You don't have this problem often! \n\nService:\nPros: We weren't rushed at all. Might be a good place to hang out and chill.\nCons: Our server was awkward and a little scary. I think he was trying too hard to be cool or retro. Not sure. But at one point, after some banter, me saying nice to meet you to him when he told me his name, he said it wouldn't be when he followed me home and hurt my pets. WTF?? I think he was trying to be funny?!? But WHO DOES THAT? No one jokes about killing my pets! That left me with a bad taste in my mouth to start the night. This comment alone made me think about less stars than I'm giving it, though I don't want to dock a place for one person's inappropriateness. He didn't bother us, which is nice if you're hanging out, but then when we wanted the check, it took awhile to get it and I finally gave him the cash at the counter because I sat with the bill and money waiting for a minute and it was SO HOT that we wanted to get out of there. \n\nPrice: $52 (without tip) for 4 drinks and 3 desserts.

What I remembered was small portions that were expensive. And a very small menu.\n\nThis is the kind of place I'd go for happy hour, appetizers, drinks or desserts. Not really a dinner type place. First off, there are only 2 vegetarian options for dinner that aren't salads- a grilled cheese or a portabella sandwich. Not the best selection. \n\nWe got 2 appetizers, which were the highlights of the meal. First, the hummus, which came with pita bread (grilled and fried). The portion was very good sized but not enough bread came with it. We also ordered the goat cheese appetizer, which is basically marinara with goat cheese in it with garlic bread slices to soak it up. YUM! It was delicious. Also not enough bread, but we got some more (not sure if they charged us for it or not). Was pleasantly surprised by the portions- there were 6 of us and we all got our good fill.\n\nI remember ordering the tapas salad, which is really good, but decided to be different and go for the beet salad. I used to like beets a lot, and I was feeling adventurous. It was a very nice presentation, with beets, goat cheese, and pesto sauce, plus a few greens. It was pretty good but a few too many beets for me - I had to cleanse my palate with my boyfriend's fries (which were DELICIOUS). When I got home, I started feeling a little sick. Maybe the beets didn't agree with me. In any case, I'm glad I tried something out of the ordinary.\n\nThe service was really good - our waitress was attentive and the busboys kept our (super tiny) glasses full.\n\nIt got very loud in there, especially with a few hen parties going on around us.

At all.\n\nWe had a large group - probably about 14 people. First mistake. NEVER, EVER go here with a group, unless you like having to use a calculator and split the check at the end. They won't split checks ""because it's tapas"" - uh, ok. Allison B and I shared some and we each paid for a couple - it wasn't like we wanted them to split each of them in half. \n\nThis made me want to order less after I found out, so I only ordered one drink (before I found out). Several others did the same - one more thing to have to add on the calculator at the end. So we refrained. The drink I ordered was kind of unremarkable. It looked pink and was fizzy but didn't taste special.\n\nAllison and I split the broccoli, falafel, saganaki (fried cheese), tyropita (3 cheeses in phyllo) and the chickpea and feta patties.\n\nThe broccoli came in a lemony tasting sauce and was just ok for me. It wasn't cooked enough - still crunchy.\n\nThe tyropita was ok. Probably the best thing I had.\n\nThe saganaki has a cool presentation but it didn't have the crunchy outer shell I was used to and didn't taste like the others I've had at more authentic Greek places. The waitress asked if I wanted pita with it, which they charge for (but she didn't tell me that...) Of course - pita is a given.\n\nThe Feta and Chickpea cakes were gross. Bland, mushy and totally unappetizing. I didn't eat more than 1 or 2 bites.\n\nThe Falafel was the same. Super HUGE patties, totally mushy inside, no flavor. They came on a pita with feta and taziki on the side and even dousing them didn't make it better.\n\nThe service was fine. The waitress was efficient but not at all friendly. The belly dancer was there and was good.\n\nAt the end, I got out my calculator and calculated. I wrote down our totals and names so the waitress could easily match the amounts to our credit cards. And then, it got weird. The waitress told me that the amounts wouldn't work with their computer - and that every amount had to be rounded to the nearest 5 cents. So, if I owed $15.18, I would have to pay $15.20. WTF?!?! I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. And I eat out a LOT. What kind of computer does that? A totally shitty one. \n\nThe space is super cute, so much potential.

He orders up 5 tequila shots and we take them. Well, it was time for me to go, and as I settle up I notice all 5 shots on my tab - excuse me?

It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left.

I don't remember much about the food, but was introduced to dirty martinis and fell in love w/ them.  Our experience here tonight was very mixed.  Our server took our drink orders and looked irritated when Ron didn't order anything.  Sherri ordered a Bombay Sapphire martini w/ a lemon twist, I ordered a dirty martini and Alan ordered a Turbodog.  She brought water glasses filled w/ ice and again looked annoyed when I asked for water w/o ice.  She brought one glass and gave it to Alan.  We ordered fried chicken livers as an appetizer.  Eventually our martinis arrived and they just looked wrong.  Sherri's was yellow and mine was just too dark.  The server explained to Sherri that she had told the bartender what Sherri ordered and the bartender had put in lemon instead.  She wanted Sherri to taste it, which she did and it was much too sweet.  Meanwhile I tasted mine and it was so heavy on the olive juice as to be undrinkable.  I sent mine back too.  Our server brought us new drinks, explaining that she had mixed them herself.  She waited until we tasted them, which we did and heartily approved.  She made a great drink. \n\nNext we ordered our mains.  Alan ordered the stuffed peppers, Sherri ordered appetizers of crawfish etouffee and barbecued oysters w/ a side of collard greens, Ron ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a Turbodog.  I ordered a fried shrimp plate.  Each of our plates came w/ two sides and cornbread.  I chose collard greens and mac 'n cheese.  We waited and waited.  The table next to us got their appetizers and cornbread.  Our cornbread never came.  Finally our mains arrived.  Alan really liked his, as did Sherri w/ hers.  My shrimp were delicious, as were the greens.  The mac ' cheese was fine.  Ron was happy w/ his spaghetti.  I asked our server what happened to our chicken livers.  She brought one order of cornbread, which we shared.  After we'd finished our mains the livers arrived w/o apology or explanation.  They were good, but would have been better if they had arrived much earlier as they appetizers we'd intended.

I got a call around 2:30 saying that my 2013 car had ""only failed in three areas.""  Did you just do a double take?  So did I.  I was honestly flabbergasted.

I never expected to have to replace any of the tires during the duration of my 3-year lease.

Immediately she told me to call someone else because they don't carry a ladder with them. Lol, ok??? It should have been clear to me from that point that this contractor was going to be a waste of time but I told her there was roof access from inside the building and we moved forward. \n\nThe day of the appointment came and the door leading to the roof access had swollen from humidity -- because this is Philly and we were midway through our third heatwave of the season. Their technician ""wasn't able"" to get inside and so he left, insisting that the door was locked. There is no lock on it. I stopped by, pulled the door open and called back but Mrs. H told me that when the technicians don't have access, they leave. So she re-scheduled me for a week later. Fine. Whatever.\n\nOn the second visit, Jason Hull himself came out. He diagnosed the issue as being that whoever worked on the unit last had taken out the disconnect and put it back in the wrong way. There were no mechanical failures, according to him. He said give it a few hours, temperature should drop 2 degrees per hour or so. So we waited a full weekend. By Monday, it was still 82 degrees inside the apartment.\n\nI called American Home Shield and they re-assigned Hull's to me. I had to reach out to them multiple times as they did not call me to set anything up. Jason insisted that that he had solved the issue during his first visit and if I was still having problems, it was because the unit needed routine maintenance and cleaning. I asked him how much they charge for it and he said they don't do it unless there's a water source near the unit. Reminder: this unit is on the roof of a four-story apartment building. \n\nBy this point I was pretty sick of their shit and had my own HVAC contractor clean and maintenance the unit so Hull would stop blaming it on anything else. After the cleaning was done and the unit still wasn't working properly, I called Hull's back. It was at this point that Jason Hull continued to blame the issue on needing a cleaning and when I told him I already had that done, he told me ""well your guy didn't do it right."" \n\nSo as a quick re-cap:\nHull's misdiagnosed the issue. \nHull's then again misdiagnosed the issue without even making a trip to the property.\nHull's refused to solve the issue.\nI have the unit cleaned, and Hull continues to blame issue on cleaning/maintenance. \nHull's refuses to revisit the property. \n\nAfter our last conversation, I called American Home Shield and insisted upon another contractor as it became clear that Hull's was NOT going to help me. Before AHS could assign someone new, they needed the diagnosis of Hull's first visit. They had never sent it in. That pushed the process back another two days and when American Home Shield DID finally get ahold of the contractor to get the diagnosis, he continued to tell them that my unit needed to be cleaned. After telling AHS that I had already had this performed, they assigned a new contractor.\n\nLong story short: Stay away from this company!!!

Perhaps having a seperate line for pick up and drop off of equipment since we seem to take 2 minutes compared to those paying their bills and arguing over their bills could be a wise choice.\n\nFor the amount most people pay for Comast in a given month, I don't think adding 1-2 additional hourly employees to your Saturday Schedule would be asking too much.",2012-09-11,21:19:42

Both my experiences as a party of 3 warranted 4 stars but my experience this past weekend as a party of 7 to celebrate my birthday was not as good.\n\nWe were promptly greeted upon arrival and seated at a large booth.  They allowed us to order first for the two toddlers in the party which is always good.  Trouble is that the rest of us waited an additional 30 minutes to get our food after the toddlers were served.  We arrived before 5pm on a Sunday ANC the adults did not receive their entrees until 550PM.  By then, the toddlers were done and ready to run amok. \n\nThe kid meals themselves were not easily handled by the children.  The bun on the cheeseburger meal was huge and outnumbered the patty at least by a ratio of 6:1.  The chicken strips were oddly enough in what appeared to be a thick need batter that my 5 year old could barely bite through.  Side note: kids' meals here do not come with fruit/cookie/dessert.  \n\nFor appetizers we shared the spinach artichoke dip (yummy) with warmed tortilla chips BUT our plate had what seemed to be the end of a bag with 50% broken so much that we could not put any dip on them.\n\nNext, we shared the southwest egg rolls which were a big hit with everyone!  They come with a cilantro ranch style dipping sauce.\n\nAnd we also shared the jalapeño cheese bites which came out like warm and not ooey gooey at all - it was as if they sat for 10 minutes before coming to us.  And as far as spice goes, I didn't notice any at all.  I'm not sure these would pass the test even if they were piping hot.\n\nFinally... Dinner arrives.  I have to admit that my steak fajitas were excellent - moist, tender, flavorful BUT the $4 add on spicy garlic lime shrimp were a huge disappointment.  The shrimp were laid atop the skillet and not even the tiniest bit hot - they were room temp and rubbery :-( Pretty steep to charge $4 for rubbery room temp. Shrimp.\n\nAlso in out party, a 6 oz. sirloin was enjoyed cooked to perfection, ribs, and lettuce wraps.\n\nOverall the food was pretty good but it was the service or lack there of for timing that was a complete bust.\n\nEnded the meal without dessert because by that time the children were ready to leave.\n\nOverall, I'd come back again in a smaller group but it was a bust for my party of 7.",2014-04-02,13:44:18

We were seated at 530 pm and promptly greeted by a pleasant waiter but he smelled strongly of cigarette smoke which lingered in the air a few minutes after each of his initial visits for both the drink order and deliver of our drinks.\n\nWe both opted for the Executive Dinner with preset options for Downtown Dining Week.\n\nWe started with an Amuse Bouche to cleanse our pallets of salmon, mango salso, caviar, and creme fresh.  The flavours were perfectly balanced and absolutely divine!  \n\nShortly after, homemade brioche bread with organic butter and volcanic sea salt arrived that tasted like it fell from the heavens.  I have never had a more delicious or flaky bread combination in my life!\n\nFor starters, they did not have the Three Mushroom Ravioli availalbe so hubby opted for the replacement Potato Gnocchi and I, the Jumbo Prawns.  Both starters were phenomeal.  The Gnocchi cooked to perfection and the Jumbo Prawns alive with the flavours of the orange jalapeno emulsion and crispy polenta!  \n\nFor mains, my husband had the Heritage Farm Alberta Angus Stiploin ($44 on the regular menu) with redwine infused mushrooms, truffle mac 'n cheese, peppered cauliflower, and tangerine aioli.  The sides were AMAZING - and the tangerine aioli to die for with the peppered cauliflower but the steak was quite disappointing.  He had ordered medium rare but it was most definitely medium but I don't blame the chef for making the steak medium because in places the steak was a 1/2"" thick or less.  The meat was tough and difficult to saw through with the steak knife at times.  If we had come on a normal night and ordered off of the regular full price menu, I would have sent the steak back without hesitation for both the quality of meat and the steak not being cooked to medium rare as ordrered.  Additionally, the presentation of the dish was messy with the sauce running all over the plate.  I took a pic and uploaded it before hubby had even touched the plate.\n\nUnfortunately, my main compared to that of my husband's main.  I ordered the Wild Coho Salmon and Crab Brandade - barigoule beurre blanc, mustard, celeriac puree, and layonnaise potato.  Just like the hubs, my sides were delicious!  Really, they couldn't have been better but my salmon was overcooked and dry :-(\n\nReally, to have the substance of the meal - the two mains (steak and salmon) be overcooked for both and a poor cut of meat for the other, is such a disappointment.\n\nIt's the same scenario where if I had odered the salmon off of the regular menu at either $37 or $39, I would have sent it back.\n\nFor dessert, my husband ordered the chocolate tart served in two small quarter pieces.  The presentation was beautiful with fruit atop and two flavours of coulis alongside but the tart itself was not something we would order again.  \n\nI ordered the chocolate creme brulee served along side two berries and raspberry coulis.  The creme brulee was delicious!  I would order the creme brulee again and again.\n\nOur server was the perfect gentleman throughout the meal and we couldn't have asked for a better service experience aside from the intial cigarette smoke smell.\n\nDespite the amazing starters and sides, I honestly cannot say that we will return.  To have our two mains be overcooked and the cut of meat itself, to not be up to par, it doesn't make me want to return.  If I were rating the starters and sides, it would be 5 stars all the way.  But when I look at the Yelp rating system, I just can't bring myself to give it 4 stars = ""Yay, I'm a fan.""  So that leaves me with only 3 stars to choose = A-Okay. If I were rating the main meats alone, it would be 2 stars = ""Meh, I've experienced better.""\n\nWildflower Grill did not live up to the hype for us and we love their sister restaurant, East.

I'm not usually a meaty kind of girl but hubby was super excited to try this one!  I like the crust - chewy but light and the sauce was flavourful!\n\nMy toddler had a kids' meal of chicken strips with steamed veggies for a side and there are onions in the veggies - BIG THUMBS DOWN!  What toddler likes steamed red onions in their veggies!  Also - the dessert options with her kids meal were truly odd - my daughter chose the chocolate pizza which turned out to be a little chocolate in the shape of a pizza (think chocolate coin) - not what I expect at a restaurant.  Perhaps pictures of the options would be helpful.  I mean - they didn't even offer a small scoop of ice cream as an option for the kids dessert and how much could that really cost them?  \n\nThey would get 4 stars for the pizza but 2 stars on the toddler meal so it averages out to 3 stars for my overall review.\n\nService was a bit slow - I inquired about eggs in the meatballs because my baby has an egg allergy and it took nearly 10 minutes for the server to get back to me.  At first she said there wouldn't be eggs in meatballs but I asked her to check with the chef anyway, and sure enough, their ingredient book listed it - not too surprising as eggs are frequently used as a binding agent.\n\nHubby and I shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert which was delicious but the ice cream scoop on top amounted to maybe 5-6 spoonfuls - quite pitiful.  The Sticky Toffee itself was yummy but we could have used a little more ice cream.\n\nAs a side note, I took my daughter to the women's washroom which smelled atrocious!  Whatever chemical they used in there smelled like a freaking urine cake - I seriously wanted to vomit.\n\nSo I'm left 50/50 on this one - Pizza was quite good, toddler meal was disappointing, and dessert was good but needed more ice cream.  We would have liked to order the special of the day for an appetizer (1/2 price wings) but it was quite difficult getting our server's attention for normal things like napkins and water refills so we never did get to order the Wings not that we needed any more food!  Between the two of us we only ate 1/2 the large pizza.\n\nI think we will try them again but without a kid or two in tow.\n\nI uploaded pics of the pizza!

I was told it would be just another minute or so.\n\n10 minutes later... still no food.  \n\nWe had to flag down our server to inquire what was going on and request refills of pop and water even though we had already been here for an hour at this point.\n\nAnother 5 minutes later... my entire party of 6 has finished their entire meals and I'm still waiting on my pizza sans onions even though it only takes 90 seconds to cook the pizza in their 900 degree farenheit oven which the server had proudly explained to us.\n\nThe manager came over and apologized and said my pizza was being cut up and would be here in a minute.\n\n5 minutes later... my pizza arrives - part of the curst burned black... Okay, whatever.  I take my first bite and the middle of the pizza isn't cooked - it's doughy/raw in the middle!\n\nI had ordered the SAN ANDREAS Pizzetta described as:\nExtra virgin olive oil, garlic, and oregano base, fresh mozzarella and chili-lime marinated roasted chicken. Baked, topped with avocado, diced tomatoes, slivered red onion, cliantro, drizzled with light cream, lime wedge.\n\nI have had this pizza previously at a different location and LOVED it... however, this time was not love at first bite!\n\nThe server comes to ask how my pizza is and I tell her but add that I don't want to wait for another one to be cooked as my entire party has already finished their meal.\n\nI nibble at my pizza but couldn't bring myself to finish the raw and burnt dough.\n\nA few minutes later the manager comes by, apologizes and says they will be taking care of my portion of the bill.   I thank the manager - everyone pays their bill - and we are on our way.\n\nSo disappointing!  And I had been so excited to introduce 2 of my girlfriends and my mother to Famoso's for the first time.  \n\nUnfortunately this will be our last visit to this location - I haven't given up all together.  But next time we'll stick to the newer location on 137 avenue and St. Albert Trail where it's clean, bright, airy, and modern!\n\nSorry Famoso's... Don't know if this was just bad luck or ???

We had just left a Yelp Elite Event at the EyeCare Group and didn't want the fabulous night to be over.\n\nWith a trendy lit up entrance and awesome live jazz blasting out the front door by a funky piano playing songstress, we were immediately lured in.  (Think Sublime & the Fugees gone funky jazz!)\n\nWe were quickly seated at the only available table - Yay!\n\nThe music was a little loud for my liking and my voice is hoarse this morning from trying to talk with my girlfriends.\n\nUnfortunately, the music was the highlight of our evening a Lit; But I digress...\n\nWe were greeted by our server, Jess, within a few minutes.  Between the sheer volume of music and it being our first visit to Lit, we needed a little more time.\n\nAfter finally decided, we ordered a pizza and an appetizer plate to share: \n\nBizmark   Pizza                                $16\ngarlic butter, prosciutto, arugula, asiago, 2 soft eggs\n\nAppetizer plate that isn't listed on their menu so I don't have the exact description but it was calamari, baked bocconcini, and breaded risotto.        $15\n\n\nI inquired with my server if the sangria was a good choice and she noted that it was.  So I ordered Sangria and water, my gf a glass of red wine, and the dd had water.  \n\nOur beverages arrived a few minutes later and my sangria was absolutely horrid.  Maybe it just wan't the right red wine base for me but I did not like it at all.  I couldn't even force myself to sip it.  So I drank my glass of water instead and waited and waited... About 15 minutes later our food arrived.  I again waited.  Our server didn't notice that my drink was still 100% full and also did not come back to ask how we liked our choices.  About 5 minutes later, I called to our server and asked her to take the sangria away.  She didn't ask if I would like to order something in its place - just took it away and didn't come back.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later she picked up our dishes and had never asked if we needed anything.  I eventually walked over to the bartender to ask for more water.  \n\nWhen we initially ordered our food, I inquired if the desserts were shareable or single servings - she had said they were shareable and I indicated I was interested in the tiramisu.\n\nWell, she never returned.  So we put on our coats and sat at the table another 15 minutes before again walking up to the bar to ask for the bill.\n\nTo her credit, the sangria was taken off my bill and she did tell me she would have it taken off - but that should be standard practice.\n\nWith regards to the food, the complimentary truffle popcorn was nice BUT some of our popcorn was burnt.  Yep, that's right - burnt popcorn.  The appetizer plate was good - the calamari was cooked to perfection.  The baked bocconcini was good but nothing to write home about - wrapped in prosciutto with a pesto drizzle.  The breaded risotto was good - but again nothing to write home about.  The portions were small but that's not a deal breaker me.  It was obvious the food was cooked with love but I would only repeat the calamari again; that being said, I do not intend to return.\n\nThe pizza was fairly bland and parts of the thing dough were overcooked and almost crunchy.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE a good arugula and prosciutto pizza so don't get me wrong - this one was not as good as the one Famoso offers at all of their locations.  I did enjoy the over easy egg on top - it gave it a surprisingly creamy texture and taste.\n\nI uploaded pictures of the ""lit"" bar as well as our food items - so take a peek!\n\nAgain, the atmosphere was great - the music superber (but too loud) but the food and, most importantly, the service will not have me wanting to come back.\n\n2 stars for me based upon the atmosphere and music.  If it were based solely on the food and service, I'd be leaning towards 1.5.\n\n\n\nPS - As a total aside, Liv's picture of the same appetizer plate had nearly double the food we had and another item!  Her picture shows bruschetta and 3 of the breaded risotto balls and three calamari and rather than the two we received... Hmm... Interesting.  Even for $2 or $3 more it would have certainly seemed like more food to have a couple slices of bruschetta.\n\nPPS - In looking at my photos of the menu I took in order to recap the ingredients and prices for you, the menus are filthy dirty :-(  Big pet peeve of mine!",2013-02-08,21:18:18

I'm sorry to say it would probably fold in a year or so. The food is just not that good. The MENU is great, but the results are disappointing. \nFirst off, they serve a lot of local standards that are (let's face it) more flavorful with the non-vegetarian stuff they put in there. Do red beans and rice have some sort of non-veggie something? Because they usually taste a lot better than they do here.  \nThe other menu items are fairly standard vegetarian restaurant items that would have the pants beaten off them by more accomplished restaurants in other cities.  For instance, take the mango ""chicken"" salad. There's a place in New York (Red Bamboo... what's with the bamboo vegetarian places?); it makes this same dish. Their ""chicken"" is worlds better, it is served beautifully in scooped mango halves with tons of diced mango inside, and it is the same price in ... New York as it is at this place.  \nHere, you get a few chunks of decent soy protein and some diced mango ...particles that would have been easier to eat with an escargot fork, given their size.\nSo basically, Cafe Bamboo is distinctly okay.

We figured they were too busy to answer the phone when we called to make sure they were open so we attempted anyways.

I wanted so badly to love this new venture and always welcome new food establishments that are within a 2mile radius of home. So I arrived with 4 other newbie patrons. We sat down and wanted a little history of restaurant, why they opened, what their specialty was, etc....the waiter basically told us the owner had a falling out with the people at andrius o'reilly next door and split and opened to compete with them. Okay so I guess no special reason it was a pizzeria or anybody's special recipe or anything. So we asked about the drink specials.... Well they do have those $1 drinks....half pints....waiter suggested a full pint for $2 as the half pints were literally 2 sips he said..... Well then, advertise $2 pints, geez!\n\nThen came time to order. The menu basically has pizza, a few more bread items, cheesy breadsticks, a few salads to choose from and that's it. don't come if you aren't craving carbs. We asked for the caesar salad with the dressing on the side and were informed the dressing can't be on the side because it came dressed.  That sounds disgusting that the salad was premade. How long was the dressing sitting with the lettuce? The cheesy bread was good gooey with cheese. The pizza was very mediocre. Nothing special at all.  The service left something to be desired.  There were only 2 people working total.  I think they cooked, cleaned, served, bartended, pretty much ran the whole place. Luckily there were only about 5 tables full.  The services was still slow and the waiter kept forgetting our items we asked for or to get the next round of beers we ordered.  Then to top the night off he asked us if we remember how many rounds we ordered because he forgot to write them down.  We all gave him a look, he left and just charged us so none of us knew if it was right or not but left feeling uneasy. To make up for the $2 pints, we found they charged $9 for a glass of wine which sells for $10 a bottle at the grocery store.  The price was not on the menu so not sure if that is the normal price or the sale price.   The salad that I ordered never came with a breadstick like stated on the menu. \n\nit's kind of hard to get to if you don't know where you are going. the entrance is through the alley that directly behind Mortons and directly west of Scottys.

I was really looking forward to some sushi, but failed to order it because it was so expensive. Ha! The irony in that.\n\nI'm sure I'd give the place 5 stars if it wasn't so damn expensive. One of my friends and I ordered the crab cake special (2 crab cakes, absolutely no filler and totally delicious) with a side of steamed veggies and wasabi potatoes and were later shocked to find out this special entree was $30. It was good, but come on. We left very unhappy about the price. Our other dining companion got the shrimp pad thai, which I'd also been considering.

Never having had a fried pickle, I tasted one of his (came chopped up and fried instead of a pickle spear fried), and they were dope.\n\nGood beer selection and, as the name would suggest, a plethora of whiskey. The whiskey is quite expensive for a mere two ounces, so we didn't partake of any, but did enjoy a Philadelphia Fish House Punch (very sweet) after a Sixpoint Righteous Rye and a bottle of the Southampton Biere de Mars.\n\nGreat atmosphere inside (moved in after eating because it got rather chilly), despite the tight squeeze.

DH had a burger, (the Serious),  which he proclaimed ""Delicious""  (a man of few words, that man o' mine)  and a mint Oreo milkshake. The Kid kept stealing sips of the Hub's shake, wore two of my onion rings like bangles before eating them,  and generally ignored her own meal. \n\nMy salad was just average, the chicken is nicely grilled, but the portion is kind of skimpy. I'd award points for that I can get it with whatever veggie toppings I want, but have to subtract a few as they always forget one or two of the choices.

Medium cut, fresh sweet onions, thin without being shoestring, freshly fried in a light, ethereal batter. They want for nothing but ketchup; ignore the fancy dipping sauces. \n\nBe warned, like Indy and the Holy Grail trying to cross the Seal of the Temple of the Crescent Moon, these rings do not transport well.
