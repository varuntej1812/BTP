We were welcome downstairs by a nice gentleman, and he got the elevator for us to go to the 37th floor. Looks like the rest of the building is for condominiums or offices, which require key cards to get in. \nUpon arrival upstairs, we were warmly greeted by two lovely ladies. And we got seated to our reserved window table. \nThe view is very nice. The first thing we noticed is Philadelphia is flat. No hills, and no fog like San Francisco. A bit hazy, or is it pollution? \nTaylor was our server, she was extremely professional and courteous and friendly. The supporting staff too, but we failed to get their names. A lady we guessed was the manager came by and checked on how we were enjoying our meal too. \nThe oysters were from Nova Scotia, and nothing to rave about. No flavor, no sweetness like Kumamoto or Kushi, or Malpeque.. we liked the hors d' oeuvres, compliments of the chef. It was something like a sea salt lavash bread with avocado. Very nice. \nThe lobster looked good, but no dipping sauce and no lemon till we asked. The bone in rib eye was cooked to the desired temperature, but too fatty. This was not from a well marbled meat, it was just plain too much fat. The truffle sabayon was excellent though. The curry fingerling potatoes were good, the lobster Mac and cheese was over cooked, the cheese was a puddle of grease. \nWe ordered the warm vanilla cake for dessert. Just great presentation, but meh on the taste. \nThe pictures on Yelp were quite different from what we got. Could it be the kitchen was not up to standard tonight. Nevertheless, the excellent service and the view made up for the average but pricey meal.",2018-05-03 02:47:23,4,0,0

The celebrant gets to choose the restaurant, so we found ourselves again at Dewey's. I think the office is PIZZA CRAZY!\n\nThe expanded parking lot is a fabulous bonus for this location. We also make sure to arrive at 11:30 a.m., especially today, it being St. Patrick's Day.\n\nTwo of us wanted to get the seasonal Harvest salad. Our server suggested we get one big one to split, it being cheaper. When was the last time that happened to you . . . . server suggesting a less expensive way to go?? But he also explained that the large salad is exactly twice the size of the small salad. We didn't know that. (I overheard him telling another table the exact same thing.) So, that was the way we went, and it worked well.\n\nThat salad is just amazing. How people think up these flavor combinations is beyond me! The bite of the cheese with the sweet of the figs and the crunch of the toasted pepitos (pumpkin seeds). Other dining partners got the large House salad and the small Greek salad. Both enjoyed immensely.\n\nNow we had a pizza dilemma. Usually four of us split two large pies. Today one wanted to go rogue and get a calzone. So, our vegetarian dining partner got a small pizza with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms, which she loved.\n\nI split a large pie with the other non-calzone dining partner. It was a seasonal special (Tipitutu, that's not it, but something -- I couldn't even pronounce it when ordering -- just said the seasonal pizza). And it's not on the online menu.\n\nThis was knockdown ridiculous pizza with proscuitto, bacon and ham, lucious cheese, toasted sesame seeds, roasted red peppers and snappy banana peppers. Whoever dreamed up this pizza is a genius! I could not stop eating it . . . and the crust . . . well, it's Dewey's crust. Nuff said.\n\nThe saltiness of the meats combined beautifully with the cheese, smoothness of the roasted red peppers, the acidity of the banana peppers and the nuttiness of the sesame seeds. Killer, killer pie!\n\nNow to the calzone. She got meatballs, diced tomatoes and mushrooms. I guess cheese is already part of the mix. That dang thing could have served three people. The dough used looked like the pizza crust, which was confirmed upon departure, as we stopped by the pizza-making window and watched the tossing and assembly. She really enjoyed that calzone, eating probably 1/4 of it, so had wonderful, tasty leftovers.\n\nSo, as we're leaving, we stopped at the pizza-making window. Watching those talented people toss the pizza was mesmerizing. One tosser saw me watching intently, so he threw a little higher and twirled a little faster. Then looked at me smiling, and I gave him a big thumbs-up! What fun!!",2011-03-18 19:50:22,5,2,0

We had booked our rooms 1 month in advance and when we arrived (almost close to 10PM on nye due to traffic), we were told that our rooms werent ready and that we needed to wait an hour...wtf??? how can rooms not be ready at 10PM when check out is at 11AM?? The evil witch at the front desk (Mariah was her name to be exact) was the worst ever. We kept asking her how come our rooms werent ready since its already 10PM and we booked over a month ago and her response was that the important people (aka top gamblers and card members) get top priority for rooms...uhh ok?? thank you for making your guest feel welcomed you evil witch. \n\nThen, after getting sick of us bitching back and forth, she said that one of our rooms were ready and the other would be ready in 10 minutes. We hung out in that room and waited for 15 minutes before calling the front desk- we were then told that the room was not ready yet and they did not have a ETA for it...WTF?? We called back an hour later and were told that our room had been ready, and the manager was suppose to call us but forgot to.....\n\nI came here 2 months ago for a concert and was treated totally different- maybe because it was a card member who booked the room for me at that time. These people really do pick and choose and will most likely treat you like shit if you're not priority.

We had booked our rooms 1 month in advance and when we arrived (almost close to 10PM on nye due to traffic), we were told that our rooms werent ready and that we needed to wait an hour...wtf??? how can rooms not be ready at 10PM when check out is at 11AM?? The evil witch at the front desk (Mariah was her name to be exact) was the worst ever. We kept asking her how come our rooms werent ready since its already 10PM and we booked over a month ago and her response was that the important people (aka top gamblers and card members) get top priority for rooms...uhh ok?? thank you for making your guest feel welcomed you evil witch. \n\nThen, after getting sick of us bitching back and forth, she said that one of our rooms were ready and the other would be ready in 10 minutes. We hung out in that room and waited for 15 minutes before calling the front desk- we were then told that the room was not ready yet and they did not have a ETA for it...WTF?? We called back an hour later and were told that our room had been ready, and the manager was suppose to call us but forgot to.....\n\nI came here 2 months ago for a concert and was treated totally different- maybe because it was a card member who booked the room for me at that time. These people really do pick and choose and will most likely treat you like shit if you're not priority. I hope that isnt the case for all the employees, but for Mariah it sure was.",2009-01-06 06:35:26,2,1,2

As a person, she is great. I went three times and each time I told her I wanted less hair as well as side bangs and layers.This never came to be! Yes, it is important to listen to your clients about their anxiety regarding changing their hair but I looked like Cousin It. \n\nI called the salon, a few days after my last cut, since co-workers had said ""Oh, I thought you were getting your hair cut."" The young lady who answered the phone said it wouldn't be an issue for me to come in, however they ""thought I was happy."" \n\nGiving this place a bad review feels vaguely mean but really... it just wasn't for me.

There were so many options to choose from. I had to stop myself after two plates but it was so tasty I wanted to eat five more plates. The service was amazing, as usual. \n\nThere were two curries (chicken and beef), tandoori chicken along with lots of vegetable based sides. I know the buffet changes based on the day so you can come each day and not get bored. You can also order off the standard menu, but most people were there for the lunch buffet. Now that I know how delicious it is, I'll have to fight the urge to come here way too often. Definitely recommend \n-------\nWas looking for a relaxed date night option and found this place on Yelp. We've tried a few Indian places in town and was intrigued by all the great reviews Shee-E had. People weren't joking when they says it's tucked away in a random, kinda shady strip mall. It took me a few u turns to find it, but I'm so glad we did.\n\nWe went on Sunday night of Veterans Day around 6p and the place was packed. Which was a good sign. And it had a number of Indian people eating there... definitely a good sign. So we put on name on the list and waited about 15 mins. I'm guessing the wait would be shorter on a non holiday Sunday.\n\nI liked that they didn't have any TVs in the restaurant. I find them distracting and this way I got to focus on enjoying some good food with my wifey.  The prices were very reasonable. We ordered the chicken tikka (yum!), chicken briyani (so good!), garlic naan and a roasted cauliflower and potato dish. The cauliflower wasn't my favorite but it was still decent. The rest of the meal was amazing. The service was attentive and we even had a celebrity siting of a local tv weatherman picking up a to go order. They have a lunch buffet that is calling my name. I'll definitely be back and I'm bringing my friends",2018-12-13 03:20:32,5,2,1

I know the buffet changes based on the day so you can come each day and not get bored. You can also order off the standard menu, but most people were there for the lunch buffet. Now that I know how delicious it is, I'll have to fight the urge to come here way too often. Definitely recommend \n-------\nWas looking for a relaxed date night option and found this place on Yelp. We've tried a few Indian places in town and was intrigued by all the great reviews Shee-E had. People weren't joking when they says it's tucked away in a random, kinda shady strip mall. It took me a few u turns to find it, but I'm so glad we did.\n\nWe went on Sunday night of Veterans Day around 6p and the place was packed. Which was a good sign. And it had a number of Indian people eating there... definitely a good sign. So we put on name on the list and waited about 15 mins. I'm guessing the wait would be shorter on a non holiday Sunday.\n\nI liked that they didn't have any TVs in the restaurant. I find them distracting and this way I got to focus on enjoying some good food with my wifey.  The prices were very reasonable. We ordered the chicken tikka (yum!), chicken briyani (so good!), garlic naan and a roasted cauliflower and potato dish. The cauliflower wasn't my favorite but it was still decent. The rest of the meal was amazing. The service was attentive and we even had a celebrity siting of a local tv weatherman picking up a to go order. They have a lunch buffet that is calling my name. I'll definitely be back and I'm bringing my friends",2018-12-13 03:20:32,5,2,1

We know Shane Magee from his former venue, where he threw a great wedding and reception for our daughter in October, 2009. Since we loved his food, we were excited to finally try his new restaurant, since it's over a 30 minute drive from where we live. We were NOT disappointed!\nThe wait staff was very pleasant and efficient. The atmosphere was boisterous in the bar area, as Happy Hour was waning, but we enjoyed that energy and found it quiet where we were seated just off that area.  We both had a beer from the draft list while looking over the menu, which is quite extensive. We usually stick to sandwiches and burgers at places like this, but since we're familiar with Shane's talent, we ordered from the entrees. I loved the braised lamb shank with cassoulet and broccoli rabe, and my husband was equally fond of the trout special. We shared the lager mussels to start, which were yummy, and passed on dessert after cleaning our plates of the large portions. I did, however, treat myself to an Irish coffee :)\nIf I had to make one suggestion, it would be to pay more attention to water refills and to make sure the daily specials are announced when the menus are presented. \nWe will definitely be back, and we only wish we lived closer.

Your membership prices will be higher. \n\nGold membership allows you everything stated above, plus the ability to rent their guns free of charge. \n\nIf you want to just go and shoot, you can do so as well, you don't need a membership to shoot/rent here. \n\nI have a small arsenal of my own firearms that I can always better myself with, close friends and family with their own small arsenals that they'd let me shoot anytime if I  wanted, so the silver membership suited me best.\n\nTheir ammo prices are very, very high, bring your own! \n\nif you rent a gun, you MUST purchase and use THEIR ammo, range rules, even with a gold membership.\n\nStaff is very friendly, and professional. I had a problem with a hand grip screw with one of my higher end hand guns, i let them correct the problem and it was fixed the same day.\n\nI just purchased another hand gun while in Kentucky, the dealer in KY is shipping my new purchase back home to Ready Aim Fire. It will be there by the time I get home. So, they can do state to state transfers. Not sure what they charge for the transfer yet, my guess is 30-50 dollars, but I'll be sure to update this review when I get back and pick it up!\n\nEDIT: 4/5/2015\nHave been a member for a year now and just renewed for another year, all the people that work there know me by name, I'm there 1-2 times a week at least. Staff hasnt changed much if any, all great guys over there. They won't let you shoot .223/5.56 or larger rifle rounds. Shotguns are allowed.",2015-04-06 00:53:37,4,2,0

The environment feels very welcoming and the staff really takes the time to answer your questions. They seem to really care about their patients and making a pregnant woman feel comfortable in a painful situation. The rooms have great furniture with plenty of room to make patient guests feel comfortable too. The food is really good too making a couple day stay more than manageable. The reason I don't give this hospital a perfect 5 is because they are somewhat lacking when it comes to the comfort of the spouse. My husband stayed with me for the 2.5 days I was here and the hospital doesn't allow your spouse to order food at meal times. This ended up being an inconvenience because when it was time to take care of my newborn, he wasn't always there to help me feed and change  him because he had to go to the cafeteria to eat. It's hard enough when you are trying to recover from the birthing experience and just a little while later you cannot rest because you have to care for your newborn and your spouse would be there to help at all times, if he didn't have to exit to get food. I mean come on, I understand the man isn't physically giving birth, but the experience is exhausting for him too and a meal would be a nice gesture.

Already horrendous lines and huge amounts of people waiting in the bar area. I just assumed that there people were hanging out but they all had luggage. I waited in line and was helped by a gentleman with glasses ( sorry, didn't catch the name ) and he tells me that my room isn't ready ... "" Check in with is in an hour but we will text you when your room is ready."" Huh?! You're kidding me, right? \n\nSo I wait with my 2 volleyball players tired from 6 hours of game play, 8 year old son and all our luggage. An hour passes, people still waiting for rooms and no text that my room is ready. My 2 girls are asleep on the chairs and I wait in line to follow up on my room. Other people in the line let me cut in front of them because they saw my girls asleep on the chairs.  \n\nJaden helped me and checked on the room. She said in a stoic manner,  "" its not ready , we will text you when its ready"" - so my aggravation kicked in. I pointed at my girls asleep on the chairs and she pursued to call housekeeping to see what the status was. I NEVER get to this point and im pretty sympathetic to all doing their job but this is too much. And, IMAGINE THAT, jaden says the room was ready. I was to the point to where my attitude was "" just give me the keys and let me get on with our vacation here."" \n\nWe got to floor 14 thinking we would see housekeeping ... Not one cart, employee in sight. Wow, makes you think how long we were waiting unnecessarily. We get to the room and unload all belongings....stains on the sheets. We call down to front desk and they call for housekeeping again. They did not come for 20 minutes. At that point, I ripped off the flat sheet and told the girls to just use their own blankets that we, luckily brought -- just in case. \n\nThis is supposed to be 4 star? I've stayed at Circus Circus with better customer service and 1000 x's faster service. \n\nThe Pepper mill Deluxe  room with 2 beds was like a standard room, extremely small with horrible deco. I literally had to turn my body to sit at the chair placed by the window with the view of the Atlantis down the street that we should have stayed in.  The TV glitched every 30 seconds. \n\nI had to try to make the best of what we had so we went to the pool at about 6. The place was so dirty with used glasses, bottles and plastic cups EVERYWHERE!!! No clean towels, so, of course, I had to complain! They finally pushed a yellow container over to the pool area with clean towels 30 minutes later. I cleaned an area to sit in and watched my kids swim. \n\nThe only stars I would give is to the Island Buffet. The hostess and our waitress were extremely nice, she listened to my girls complain and wished that it would have never happened to us and that things like this happen all the time to many customers at the Peppermill but nothing gets done. I do not want to mention her name, in fear that she gets fired but she will know who she is when she reads this. She is a gem. \n\nThis will be our last time staying here, I would hope that you live up to your "" 4 star "" rating. Circus circus had so much better service and that's pretty bad. I wanted to make this resort stay in Reno a good one -- you would think that $200 per night would be decent - not this time. Never again.",2016-04-18 15:06:54,2,2,2

I pointed at my girls asleep on the chairs and she pursued to call housekeeping to see what the status was. I NEVER get to this point and im pretty sympathetic to all doing their job but this is too much. And, IMAGINE THAT, jaden says the room was ready. I was to the point to where my attitude was "" just give me the keys and let me get on with our vacation here."" \n\nWe got to floor 14 thinking we would see housekeeping ... Not one cart, employee in sight. Wow, makes you think how long we were waiting unnecessarily. We get to the room and unload all belongings....stains on the sheets. We call down to front desk and they call for housekeeping again. They did not come for 20 minutes. At that point, I ripped off the flat sheet and told the girls to just use their own blankets that we, luckily brought -- just in case. \n\nThis is supposed to be 4 star? I've stayed at Circus Circus with better customer service and 1000 x's faster service. \n\nThe Pepper mill Deluxe  room with 2 beds was like a standard room, extremely small with horrible deco. I literally had to turn my body to sit at the chair placed by the window with the view of the Atlantis down the street that we should have stayed in.  The TV glitched every 30 seconds. \n\nI had to try to make the best of what we had so we went to the pool at about 6. The place was so dirty with used glasses, bottles and plastic cups EVERYWHERE!!! No clean towels, so, of course, I had to complain! They finally pushed a yellow container over to the pool area with clean towels 30 minutes later. I cleaned an area to sit in and watched my kids swim. \n\nThe only stars I would give is to the Island Buffet. The hostess and our waitress were extremely nice, she listened to my girls complain and wished that it would have never happened to us and that things like this happen all the time to many customers at the Peppermill but nothing gets done. I do not want to mention her name, in fear that she gets fired but she will know who she is when she reads this. She is a gem. \n\nThis will be our last time staying here, I would hope that you live up to your "" 4 star "" rating. Circus circus had so much better service and that's pretty bad. I wanted to make this resort stay in Reno a good one -- you would think that $200 per night would be decent - not this time. Never again.",2016-04-18 15:06:54,2,2,2

The menu is extensive and caters to many with several gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options. We ordered the snapper tacos that came street taco style and were some of the best tacos we've had, prepared well and great flavor. We also ordered the short rib tacos, they were ok. We also ordered the lamb kofta, those were fantastic and the Brussels with pork belly were absolutely delicious!!! The only thing we felt was a slight disappointment was the cauliflower trio, though great in taste, you only get about 4 chunks and it's $10, a bit pricey for what it is. Lastly we ended with a lavender pot de Creme and gluten free chocolate cookies, they were both fantastic. Overall a great experience and atmosphere. A few kinks they need to work out, like listing on the menu that the snapper tacos are vegan... haha, I'm sure in time they will work the small stuff out.\n\nHad to add, still months later one of our absolute favorite places to go, great food and cocktails and the gluten free options are not limited which makes this a great place for us!!

But I'm super glad that I went back tonight with my father and grandfather! I decided to jump in an try new things! The two other times I've been, I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of the potato and bacon hash - which is absolutely incredible! But I didn't want to get caught in that rut where I order the same thing every time. So my dad helped me switch things up! He ordered The Three Pigs sandwich and I ordered their special sandwich for the evening - beef brisket with Swiss. And we didn't swap out the side, we went with the fries and pickled veggies. And let me tell you, these fries are spectacular! They're thin cut (think McDonald's size), perfect amount of crunch and perfectly seasoned! As for those veggies - I usually don't care for pickled things, but with these I could really appreciate their fresh taste. I believe they made them and they haven't been sitting in a jar of chemicals on the shelf for the past three years. \n\nThe brisket sandwich was enormous! - think long sub sandwich. Now, this sandwich was very nicely seasoned and very yummy and I would recommend it to everyone. However, The Three Pigs, was out of this world and puts every other dish to shame! The meat on it's own was so freakin' flavorful! I don't even remember what cheese was on top because it didn't matter! I'm glad that this is one their menu all the time - I can return and have it again soon! \n\n(Then there's dessert. I will warn you, their desserts run a little small, which makes me sad.) Their chocolate ice cream with candied bacon is simply out of this world! But, like I said, I was determined to try new things! So dad and I shared two scoops of ice cream (cinnamon and coconut brown sugar) and the Chocolate Malt  Pudding. Ice had the cinnamon ice cream in the past and have always loved it, but I have to say that the rest of the dessert put it to shame! The coconut brown sugar tasted less like coconut and more like the most amazingly delicious brown sugar ever! Both dishes came with a gingerbread cookie which was surprisingly sub-par comparatively - too cakey and not very gingery. But the pudding also came with two toasted marshmallows! The pudding was very smooth and almost had the consistency of a thickened caramel sauce. It was super sweet and you get a pretty decent portion so I was very happy!

Fingers crossed that at least one of these desserts are still on the menu!next time I visit!",2017-01-23 12:45:54,4,12,2
