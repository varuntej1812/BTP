I was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn near the airport and called this Papa John's around 10pm.

I knew I would have to wait to get in but that is something you are used to when it comes to ""hot spot"" eating.   There was over a 2 hour wait which is not great but still doable.  What was unacceptable was the hostess at the front.  She was flat out rude, could care less about the customer.   No I am sorry about the wait or have a drink at the bar or anything. She never even asked if we wanted to put our name in like most other places in the area.   Someone should coach her to tell her she works in the service industry.  \n\nShame just a pure shame this hostess is the experience she gives customers when they go there to have an Iron Chef experience.",2013-11-24,14:36:29

I went to Total Serenity yesterday for a massage, and it was a horrific experience.  I'm trying to be gentle, because the woman who took care of me seemed to be somewhat nice. However, she has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE with professional massage. I get better backrubs from my 7 year old niece.\n\nI would have to agree with one of the other people who posted before me who said that the masseuse had no technique, just straight up and down rubs.  At first, I thought this was just her way of prepping or warming up my muscles. I kept thinking to myself,""Okay, NOW the real massage will begin!!"" LOL. Well, after saying that about 20-30 times, I knew this woman didn't know the first thing about a REAL massage. This made me mad, because my back and neck were full of stress knots.\n\nWell, the worst was yet to come.  She moved on to my legs and started doing some crazy technique that made me want to yell out in pain!!!  I get massages fairly often at other places, so I'm pretty sure she was doing it WRONG. Every person who ever massaged my calves and thighs did it in a relaxing way to get the kinks out.\n\nOn top of that, I think this woman had a BUTT FETISH!!!  LOL. I'm laughing right now, but I wasn't laughing yesterday.  As she massaged my thighs, she made sure to end each stroke with a handful of my butt.Each time, she stroked it slow and sensually, almost like she thought it was turning me on!  EWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't want that kind of massage from a woman!!!  It was sooo unbelievably uncomfortable.  \n\nI felt bad, because my bf gave me the massage as one of my birthday gifts, and instead of leaving the salon relaxed and refreshed, I felt even more tense and stressed from clenching my butt cheeks every time her hand grazed and caressed it. When it was over, I couldn't get to the exit FAST ENOUGH!! lol. To add insult to injury, she had the nerve to hand me an empty envelope, indicating that she was expecting to get a tip.  Well, I ended up tipping her a few dollars, because in the end, I usually DO tip people when I receive any kind of service. Trust me, I would have rather kept that money in my wallet. \n\nI understand that for some people, the butt massage is no big deal, but I would have preferred to be asked. Don't just grab it and HAVE AT IT without my permission. This experience has me so jaded, that I doubt I will ever go to a spa for a massage again. I'll stick to Massage Envy and places in the mall. They do a better job anyway and for much less money.\n\nOh, and forget about trying to get an appointment here. It took me two weeks to get mine, because no one answered the phone during business hours, and then when you leave a message, no one calls you back!\n\nDo yourself a favor, don't go to Total Serenity for a massage. I can't speak on their other services, but massages are definitely not their forte'.",2011-07-08,21:39:56

I only reserve one star reviews for the worst of America, and your business practices give capitalism and free enterprise a bad name.

We had visited the Phoenix Diner on many occasions and always had great food and wonderful service. \n\nLast night we decided to try the ""new"" Starr Diner since we had a coupon that we found in Hometown Coupon Magazine. My kids ordered the typical child friendly meals, chicken fingers and a cheeseburger, my husband ordered the Beef & Reef dinner(sirloin steak, shrimp stuffed with deviled crab, baked potato and a veggie). I ordered the fried seafood platter ( fried clam strips, scallops and shrimp with homemade mac & cheese and a salad). \n\nThe kid's meals were average, nothing special and the cheeseburger was a little dry. My husbands steak, which he ordered medium rare, was a joke. It was a very thin piece of shoe leather, no pink at all, with a lot of fat. My clam strips were extra crispy and all of the items on my plate tasted like the had been cooked in old, dirty oil. My home made mac & cheese was watery and tasted like someone had dumped a fistful of flour into it. The sauce was completely white and soupy. \n\nBoth of my kids ordered dessert which was vanilla ice ream and tapioca pudding. The ice cream tasted like it had freezer burn and the pudding had solid firm clumps of tapioca as big as my thumb in it. \n\nAt this point we just wanted to get our check and leave. The bill came to just under $50.00 and we presented our server our debit card and a $5.00 off of any order of $30.00 or more coupon. She took it to the cashier and then promptly returned telling us that the coupon was not valid. I looked at the coupon again which reads ""$5.00 off any $30.00 purchase, not valid with other offers, expires 5/21/11"" and asked why we could not use it. We were told that since my husbands meal was a weekly ""special"" ( at $14.99) the coupon was not valid. I told our sever that the coupon should be more clear on how it can be used and her response was ""yeah we have received a lot of complaints about it"". At this point the cashier came over and asked us to please hurry and sign the slip for the debit card because she had to finish running it through. I told her that we were unhappy about not being able to use the coupon. Her response was, ""I will let them know"". I am not sure who ""them"" is but I can tell ""them"" we will not be back to their diner. \n\nWhen you own your own business customer service is key. If you and your staff are aware that other patrons have complained about the same issue then you should have something in place to correct the problem. It is not the fact that we had to pay the $5.00 it was how it was handled. We were served a below average meal and were denied using the coupon, which was brought us to the Starr Diner in the first place. \n\nI am giving the Starr Diner one star.

The other places jack the prices up. \n\nAnyhow, I'm standing about 20 feet back from the Baja Fresh counter looking at the menu, and notice a tall slender, tattooed hispanic guy standing at the ingredients, waiting for someone to approach so he can make something. As I am looking at the menu above his head, I notice his right hand go up to the side of his face. I then see him full on dig his finger into his ear. I'm talking full penetration, FINGER IN EAR, with no regard for anyone that may have been looking. The worst part? He WAS WEARING HIS GLOVE while he did this. After the finger picking, he proceeded to wipe his nose up the length of his left arm. He then returned to simply waiting by the ingredients for his next customer. No glove change, no napkins to wipe his face. Nothing. DISGUSTING DISGUSTING! This guy is working with food? Appetite lost.   (***I don't like to stand close enough for the workers to ask me for my order if I am not ready yet, that's why the guy thought noone was paying attention to him)\n\nI turned to walk the other way, and saw another Baja Fresh employee at the soda fountains in the middle of the food court. I walked over to him, and told him what I had just witnessed. I asked him to NOT point me out to the offensive employee, because I didn't want to get shanked before I left the place. I still couldn't believe it...a full on gloved finger in the ear, and this guy was going to continue making food like nothing happened. \n\nI shudder to think how many boogers and ear wax has made it into the food prepared by the clueless idiot before I pointed him out to a co-worker. Is it standard practice to NOT train the food handlers on health protocols?\n\nI was grossed out by this for days, as it seems like a serious health violation.

I'm not a sushi snob by any means. Usually I can't even tell the difference. I love sushi - all sushi is good sushi! GET IN MAH BELLY! Sigh. I learned that is not actually the case.\n\nWent last night, service was prompt, but we were also the first party in the whole restaurant walking in at 5:00pm. The complimentary edamame was nice, but cold. I prefer my edamame nice and hot.\n\nThe sushi was just terrible. The dynamite roll literally had PILES of chile pepper flakes or whatever that powder was on them, and even after scraping it off, they were so incredibly spicy to the point they weren't even good. The California rolls were bland and completely mushy. My squid nigiri tasted alright but like it had been sitting out.\n\nWhen it comes to sushi, I always finish my plate. But this is the first time in the history of EVER that it was so bad I didn't even bother finishing.\n\nThe server did not ask how our food was, which was disappointing because I would have told him. I think he could tell something was wrong though by my less-than-impressed face. He was kind of jittery and nervous nearing the end. But no move to make sure we were happy with our meal or anything.\n\nI'm guessing by the huge mix of reviews on here that your experience at Nippon Tei is largely determined by who makes your sushi. I believe ours was made by a younger guy - tall, husky, dark longish curly hair, glasses. I want to say his name is Nicholas or something? Yeah....he needs to go back to sushi school.\n\nThe dynamite roll, two orders of california rolls, a squid nigiri, a snapper nigiri, and one green tea = $40. When almost all of it is nasty? OUCH.\n\nThe quality of this sushi put me off enough that I don't think I'll be back.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Um, so I just did the math and I don't know how much the tea was, but according to their website the sushi should have only added up to $28.50. So unless that tea was like, $5, and the refill my dining partner got was not free, that order was not right. Or he really did spend $10 in tea. Either way, yeah, not going back.\n\nEDITED TO ADD AGAIN: So apparently my date ordered an Alaskan roll, and was too distracted by my awesomeness (ha!) to realize they never brought it out. So we were charged for something we never got. Lamesauceeee.",2010-09-27,12:21:25

I figured restaurant-goers would want to know about my abysmal encounter with one of the employees (possibly a shift manager, I'm not sure).\n\nI took my dad from out of town to the Black Thorn tonight. I just moved into the TGS neighborhood, the place is only a couple blocks from me, and had heard great things about their pizza. As everyone else said, the place is a gritty dive, and I enjoyed that aspect of it. The pizza itself, after waiting an hour and a half for it (which I didn't mind, we had a good time in the interim), tasted great.\n\nThe problem was that it wasn't, after all that waiting, what we ordered. My dad had ordered a supreme; was very clear - ""I want everything on it - no, not tomatoes, anchovies and artichokes, but everything else."" When it came out, they called up ""Mike F"" (we even had our initial behind it, so it was very clearly meant for us) and it looked like sausage. I was wary, but having never had deep dish before, we thought maybe the rest of the ingredients were inside. Poked at it, took a few bites. Nope, definitely just sausage. Someone must have put the wrong order in. We weren't going to wait ANOTHER hour and a half for them to remake it, so we went ahead and ate it. It *was* delicious. But not what we ordered, or paid for. I took a piece up to the man behind the bar that took my order to make sure it was sausage and calmly explain what happened, and see if we could just get the extra $4 difference back. Our exchange went a little something like this:\n\nHim: ""You ate it?! You ate someone else's pie!""\nMe: ""It's under Mike F, you gave this to us. I didn't know if it was supreme in the deep dish."" \nHim: ""God damn it! What were you thinking?!"" then screaming at the bar, pissed off: ""Is there a Mike F at the bar? Because if so, this girl ate your pizza."" The people at the bar looked shocked and embarassed for me; some nervously giggled, some gave me dirty looks. I was MORTIFIED. \nI said, ""No, Mike F is us! And this is what you gave us!"" \nHe's pacing, mumbling things, yelling at the other employees about this awful travesty I committed, flailing his arms about and making a big scene, and told me: ""You should have brought it back!"" \nMe, raising my voice now: ""I didn't want to wait another hour for you to cook another one!"" \nHim, yelling back: ""You wouldn't have had to...god damn it! Shit. YOU DON'T JUST EAT SOMEONE ELSE'S PIZZA!"" \n\nI said, ""You know what, forget it"" and stormed off to my table while he's yelling at me to ""come back and deal with this."" I'm so shocked and appalled I'm in tears.\n\nI'm at my table shaking in anger. I've lost my appetite. Another employee who witnessed the exchange comes over and apologizes on his behalf, saying, ""He gets like that"" offered to buy us a beer or something, and then said she'd talk to him and see what she could do. Turned out that he wrote ""sausage"" on the order....but still charged us the extra $4 for a supreme. So HE made the exact mistake I suspected. It wasn't someone else's pizza, it was ours. HE fucked up, and I WOULD have had to wait another hour for the right one. Yet he assumed I was a selfish fuck-up and instigated a screaming match at the bar as he accused me of stealing someone else's pizza. \n\nHe comes over a few minutes later (obviously because the girl went back and told him he's got damage control to do) and his ""apology"" was ""Sorry for getting like that, but I'm really busy."" Nice excuse (and they weren't even all that busy. The place was only half full on a Saturday night. Even then....there's no excuse!). He said he'd give us the $4 back. He also asked my dad how he paid for the pizza. ""Oh, you paid cash? SWEET. Because if you paid by card it would have been this big pain in the ass to refund you the money on the card."" Wow, how many excuses does this guy have? If we paid by card, would he have caused yet another dramatic shit storm over it? \n\nThe girl comes back over to see what he did, and she says, ""Uhhh he really should comp you the whole pizza. But I'm not the boss, he is."" (My dad asked if he was the owner and she said no, so that's my thinking in that he's a shift manager) He comes back over a few minutes later and comps us the whole thing (again, I think he was nudged to do so). And apologized again. I told him, ""Being busy is a SHITTY excuse. I've worked fast food, I've waited tables, and I'm a nurse on a busy floor in a city hospital - I know busy. You DON'T talk to people like that. You need a lesson in customer service."" At this point, he did seem sincerely sorry. I said I appreciate him trying to rectify the situation.\n\nBut I'm so infuriated I'm never going back. And telling all my friends to avoid this place like the fucking plague.\n\nI would give this place ZERO stars if I could. The 1 star is for the poor girl who was obviously mortified and tried to make the situation better.",2010-09-19,07:53:00

Not only did the coat still smell like coffee when they returned it to me, but they also broke the metal clasp on the belt in the dry cleaning machine. When I asked what happened and for some resolution, the owner told me that I should have known that metal items can get damaged in the dry cleaning machine. Isn't that why we went to a so-called expert, so he could tell us what should and should not go into the machine? Regardless, the clasp was not fixable so after about 30 minutes of arguing (during which time his wife would not stop staring at me and giving me the evil eye), he finally agreed that he would shop around for another clasp to fix it, and I should give him a week. I came back a week later, and he informed me that he didn't find another clasp but that he instead ""fixed"" the one he had broken. This mostly consisted of him painting the chipped metal.

Bad idea. I felt kind of sick to my stomach after I left. The car wasn't in yet, so I was forced to take a loaner since they were riding me hard to make the deal and give up my VW on the spot.

She chose the restaurant, having been there before, and chose the 8:30pm seating time for our party of 10. The restaurant is located off of South Street on this almost alley-like street, and the moment you walk in you grasp the concept they're trying to throw out at you: a traditional Moroccan-style meal in a setting that's supposed to mimic Moroccan interiors, with loud Middle Eastern style music (that sounded like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack). Rugs are everywhere, on the floor and wall, and you sit on low couches or cushion stools around round tables. \n\nThe meal is a 7 course prix fixe $35 per person (no a la carte menu), although they do have vegetarian alternatives to the meat dishes. The only menu they hand you is the drinks menu, which ranges from beer to wine to rose water to Coca cola. The menu is as follows:\n\nFirst course: 3 salads, eggplant, tomato-cucumber, and carrot\nSecond course: phyllo pastry filled with chicken and egg with powdered sugar and cinnamon on top. Vegetarian alternative is without chicken, just egg.\nThird course: Whole chicken, slow-cooked, either mild or spicy (we asked for spicy sauce on the side). Vegetarians get a lentil dish.\nFourth course: Either honey lamb or beef shish kebabs, we asked for both. Vegetarians have a spinach-filled rolled pastry.\nFifth course: Couscous topped with chicken, raisins, and vegetables. No chicken for vegetarians.\nSixth course: Fresh fruit bowl\nSeventh course: mint tea and baklava.\n\nThe meal was awful from the start. They sat us all the way at the top floor, in the back - we're pretty sure they continuously forgot about us throughout the meal. Our waiter looked like he was in high school, and it took him 15 minutes to get our drinks (only 4 people ordered anything); in the mean time, the music was so obnoxiously loud we could barely talk to one another, let alone the people next to us, and the air conditioning was so high that I was shivering - and I was wearing a sweater! - and even after asking them to turn it down, it was STILL cold.\n\nConsidering that its a prix fixe menu, you would expect the food to come out quickly, but we waited about 45 minutes for the first course, which isn't even cooked! Our waiter was not attentive in general, and each course took far too long to come out (he also took forever to realize we were done with each dish). The food overall was not good - edible, but where were the spices? The FLAVOR?! My bf said the lamb was good, but otherwise we were all very disappointed in the dishes. And there was waaaay too much food, we felt bad towards the end because of all the wasted food since we could barely have more than a bite of the later courses. The fruit plate mostly went into people's purses. I was most disappointed by the baklava, which was truly awful just phyllo pastry and honey WHERE WERE THE NUTS?! I'm Greek, I love baklava and this was awful. \n\nPerhaps the worst part of the evening, after suffering through awful service, bad food and too much of it, obnoxious atmosphere (which includes a belly dancer going around to each table), the waiter brings the bill and tells us AT THAT MOMENT that they take cash or check but NOT credit cards. They didn't tell us when we made the reservations, they didn't tell us at the beginning of the meal to allow us to run to a bank and get money, they had the audacity to tell us right at the end. I thought he was joking, but no. We managed to pool enough cash together, but the entire experience was not worth it and I will NEVER go back there.

Because I work, I couldn't be there to recieve the items. My sister-in-law graciously agreed to be there to receive the items when the delivery men came.\n\nMy window of delivery was 11:30-3:30 (yes, that's four hours in the middle of a weekday). When I was told my delivery time I informed the woman who called me that I was told that I could receive a phone call from the driver of the truck when they were an hour away. She said to me, ""Well, you have to REQUEST that. Are you REQUESTING that?""\n\nReally? REALLY? Yes, of course I'm requesting it. Jesus!\n\nAt 11:30 I received a call telling me that the truck was ""five minutes"" away. I told the driver that my sister-in-law was driving to my house to receive the items for me and that it'd take her 30 minutes to get there, and that I was told that the phone call would be placed when they were an hour away. He said that everything was fine and he still had some stuff to do at the house he was at previous to mine, so it should all work out perfectly.\n\nAN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES LATER they show up. Yes, they showed up an hour and ten minutes later, after they told me on the phone that they were just a few minutes away. Perhaps they got lunch? No big deal, but perhaps you could have told me that so my sister didn't rush to get there just to wait for another 40 minutes.\n\nAnyway, my SIL said that the driver and the crew were all very nice and friendly, but that the mattress I ordered was the wrong size. This shocked me as my husband and I had an extensive conversation with Neil regarding why we were purchasing this mattress, what it would be used for, and what size the bed frame was. \n\nAt this point I called the store and asked to speak with a manager. After the lies we were told about the delivery process, I was fed up with things not working out with my order. I was told that there was no manager I could speak with, but that I was going to be transferred to Paul. I do not know what Paul's role in the store is, but that's who they put me through to.\n\nPaul was friendly enough and assured me that he would take care of the situation. He told me that he tried to call the driver but got no answer, so he had me tell my sister-in-law to tell the driver that he should take the wrong-sized mattress with him and to not leave it at my house.\n\nPaul told me he'd call me back with a plan. This was at about 1:30. I received no phone call from him for the rest of the day, and when I called back to speak with him today I was told that he was off today. Thanks for telling me that yesterday, Paul.\n\nI again requested to speak to a manager. Honestly every time I've called I've asked to speak with a manager, but they are always coincidentally not around. I spoke with Dee, who was also nice enough, but really had no power to fix the situation for me. She said she was going to look to see if they had my mattress in stock in the size I wanted, and she asked if I wanted to continue to wait on hold or if I wanted to receive a call back. I asked if I would be getting a call back today and she assured me I would.\n\nIn the meantime, a few hours pass, and I call my husband and tell him the situation. We both decide that we're going to return the mattress, get a refund, and go down to the Sleepy's literally a few blocks from our house and get an appropriately sized mattress ourselves.\n\nWhen I called Dee back to tell her I wanted a refund, she tells me that the manager is now in the store, but he's in a meeting and will call me back later today.\n\nFinally the manager (Waseem?) calls me back. He's apparently not been briefed at all about my situation,  and let's just say that the conversation deteriorated very, very quickly. I held my temper during the eight (at least) previous calls I made to this place, and unfortunately for this guy I just couldn't contain my rage anymore. After a non-productive conversation where he clearly didn't want to give me a refund I ended up having my husband call to deal with it.\n\nMy husband got the same run around that I did, and it wasn't until he whipped out the ""I'm a lawyer"" card that the guy agreed to refund our money. \n\nI should have known when we were not charged tax on our items even though we live in PA (and that's where they delivered our items to) that this business had some sketchy practices. They clearly don't give a shit about keeping their word to their clients and I hope they go out of business so other people aren't put in the position to deal with their madness.

First of all, if you are going to have a special menu and close down all the other parts of your menu, don't lie about it.  When we call, tell us about it, put it on your website, and don't tell us that everything will be available when it's not.  \n\nHad the single most sub-par experience in a restaurant in stl.  The staff was definitely the B-list.  The service was atrocious.  Who in their right mind announces your wine price so that every other patron can hear? That is, after you rummage through a closet on top of us searching for the wine, can't find it, and just chose another and told us precisely how much it cost in an out-door voice.  Thanks, we came here to be judged by the other patrons, whose heads all visibly swiveled at the announcement. \n\nAlso, who runs out of bread? And if you DO run out of bread, why would you leave the bread plate, butter knife, and other bread service accoutrements out?\n\nAnd, upcharging for beef (not even filet mignon - short ribs and something else not expensive) just seems to be nickle-and diming.  It's not lobster. It's not even filet, and not, god forbid Kobe or Wagyu.  It's shortribs for crying out loud!\n\nRunning out of half the menu is bad.  Especially at 8pm. Having the rest of that menu be less than tasty is also bad.  It was also clear that SOME of the menu items in the stuff they had was running out and they were trying to save up.\n\nPart of the reason this is truly unacceptable is that for Valentine's Day you have reservations - 100% booked reservations WEEKS before V-Day.  If you can't order correctly when you know exactly how many patrons will be in, that's a problem.  It's a problem when the service is so bad the waiter apologizes at the end of it.  It's a problem when everything tastes like it was sort of nuked because you have you B-game here.  I understand Vday is a captive audience, but come on - we certainly won't be back and we certainly won't be entertaining guests here again.  They may have gotten a pretty penny out of us once, but they certainly made it so that they'll never get a repeat customer out of it.",2008-04-18,17:30:00

Maybe Mediterranean influenced, but not Greek.\n\nIt was clear from the menu that Momo's was trying to appeal to Midwestern palates.  Half the menu items weren't even in the realm of Greece. \n\nIt was also expensive.  I might have been more accomodating if the food was good, but it was not.  It was downright awful. \n\nThe taramousalata was cold potato salad with not fresh fish roe.  This is not taramousalata.  The hummus was salty, and the other dips were equally poor.  Lamb chops were pretty good, but how hard is it to screw up lamb if it's not overcooked?  Especially baby lamb chops.\n\nGrilled octopus was boiled squid. It tasted frozen and besides the obvious frozen element, it was not fresh and it was accompanied by a poor choice of spices. \n\nGetting out of the restaurant was a nightmare.  We sat with our table cleared off and a drinks finished and could not, for the life of us, flag down a waitress.  After our terrible meal all we wanted was to get out!  We had to go find more food afterwards because the portions were small (and much was uneaten).  It's not that I don't understand tapas; I do.

Like Kayleigh's rep, Stephanie was polite and friendly, but overstayed her welcome. She arrived at 6P (on time), but didn't leave until close to 8:30P. It was overly salesy and drawn out (and I work in Sales). I have a toddler who goes to bed at 8P. That was fun. I didn't mind limited options, in a way it makes it easier for me, but I do wish I had a bit more to choose from.\n\nWe selected our items and scheduled the install for 4/20 (hardwood) and 4/21 (carpet). Stephanie indicated we had to do hardwood first THEN carpet. No problem! \n\nThe Saturday prior, I received an email from Empire saying *I* had to call to confirm my appointment. I thought that to be a bit strange considering the amount of $ I was spending. I felt they should call me to confirm like most places to do, but I shrug it off and call in. \n\nI call in and placed on hold for about 15 minutes. I then tell the operator I was confirming my 2 installs. He indicated I couldn't confirm the carpet install (on the 21st) as their system didn't go ""that far out"". I asked why, but he couldn't say. I asked if there was a way he could include a note on my file that I confirm so I don't have to call back in. Nope. Not an option. I call back in Monday and after being placed on hold again, confirm. I was told they could call me the morning of my installs with a time frame.\n\nPlease keep in mind my husband and I both took time off from work to sit home and wait for the project to be complete.\n\nOn the 20th, they call me at 7:50AM. Debbie tells me that we have the best installer and how fantastic he is. Our time frame is 11A-2P, but he'll be there earlier because he's so fast and amazing! Wonderful. Debbie says the installer will call me on his way over. He was working on a job about 30 minutes from our home.\n\n11A rolls around, nothing. 12P, nothing. 1P, nothing. 1:55P, crickets. As I'm calling Empire to see what is going on, they're calling me on behalf of the installer. He was held up on his morning job and running very late as he was still working. He said he would like to give me a new time frame of 3P-5P. I'd asked the operator how he could possibly be there at 3P if he was still working and 30 minutes away. \n\nLong story short - the call with the operator was a slight battle. They wanted to do the install that evening after I made it clear 1.) I have toddler and 2.) I work full-time. You're not working until 11P outside of our rooms. Sorry. He claimed he was trying to work with me, then got annoyed we couldn't take more time off of work to get this done. I'm sorry - we don't have that luxury, sir. He then tells me the installer guaranteed a morning install for us on Thursday to get the floors in before the carpet, then when I repeated what he'd say, he retracted it saying they never guarantee installs. He told me *I* had to call in to see where the installer was at 8A the next morning......\n\nThe outcome of the call was the install would take place the next day, Thursday, when the carpet was due to be installed anyway. At that point, I didn't trust them, but threw my hands up.\n\n(We call our rep to see if she can assist/provide insight at 2:30P on Wednesday. We're still waiting on her call - it's been almost a week.)\n\nThe next morning, Debbie calls me at 7:20A while I'm driving to work to say my window is 8A-11A.\n\n8:09A - my phone rings. The installer is there. \n\nMy husband arrives home 2 minutes later from dropping our son at school to find the hardwood AND carpet installers there. The guys go in to get to work. The hardwood guys pull up the carpet. Lo and behold we have hardwood. Our rep, Stephanie, NEVER PULLED UP THE CARPET TO CHECK TO SEE WHAT WAS UNDERNEATH. This is our first home, our first install. We wouldn't have known what to check for. Now, the hardwood installer had to call CORPORATE to get a quote on hardwood floor removal. SEETHING.\n\nThe installers were fantastic. I'll give them that. They worked quickly and efficiently - communicated everything to my husband the entire way. But my rep? The main office? HORRIBLE. They are overpriced and don't give a hoot about the consumer. But boy were they quick to cash my checks!\n\n\nDO NOT USE THEM!",2016-04-25,14:26:10

I was wrong. \n\nWhen I make the appointment, they ask if I have insurance. I give her the info & she says, ""are you sure we take your insurance?"" I answered yes, but shouldn't she know if she works there? I scratched my head, but didn't think much of it. We were sent paperwork prior to our appointment. Cool - less time waiting!  \n\nA week prior to our appointment, they call to say my husband isn't covered & would have to pay out of pocket for his exam. I called back & assured them he was. They double checked, saw I was correct, and said ""Oh, our mistake. Don't worry. You're fine."" \n\nOur appointment was for 10A on a Saturday morning. We were taken in right away! The assistant takes us back for the various tests. She asks if we were there for contacts. I said yes. She says ""let's forget the tests"" & brought us into an exam room. On my paperwork, I had indicated that glaucoma ran in my family.Shouldn't I be at LEAST given a glaucoma test? Yes, I should have said something, but trusted them since they're the eye doctor. My mistake. \n\nOver the next 2 hours we rotated in & out of the chair and the exam room. The doctor left us (he was literally looking at my eye, turned around, & walked out) to take care of another patient. We were put back into the waiting room for about 20 minutes - TWICE. Why? I don't know.\n\nThe doctor doesn't make one mention of the large bump on my husband's eye & our eyes were dilated without warning/prior knowledge. He put the drops in, then told us what it was. Um. How were we supposed to drive home? We couldn't see well at all. It was too late to say anything.\n\nMy prescrip changed pretty dramatically, yet I was told to put my old contacts in .... after my eyes were dilated. The contacts were then stained yellow from the drops. On top of not being able to see from the dilation, I couldn't see through my contacts because they were discolored. In all my years of eye exams, I was always given a fresh pair of contacts with the new prescription. Am I missing something?\n\nMy husband's left contact had been bothering him the month leading up to our appointment. But he had to wear his contacts to drive. The prescrip in his glasses was over 10 years old. The contacts were more recent. The doctor noted how irriated his eye was from it. He held it up to a flashlight & saw that it was coated in debris that couldn't be removed. His vision changed as well. Guess what? He was told to put his old contacts in too. Now I opened my mouth & asked for a trial pair for him. Unreal.\n\nOur exam is finally over & we head out to order contacts & new glasses. We have VSP, so we get a $150 credit to use toward new glasses OR towards the contact lens exam/contacts. Our choice, yet, we weren't given an option. We were told to pay for the lens fitting. I was confused, but since we were going to use the $150 toward glasses, we didn't think much of it. We pay & wait to get new glasses. And we wait.... and wait... and wait..... The female employee tells us to pick out frames, it would be a little bit of a wait (there were 2 people being helped & 2 folks in front of my husband & I). We tell them we have our old frames & just need the lenses done. We take a seat & wait 45 minutes. Not one person had moved. The team was slow as molasses. Now we were there going on 2.5 hours, so we leave.\n\nAfter all that, we didn't even order contacts. Yet, 2 weeks after my husband receives a message saying his contacts are ready. They ordered without approval. THEN told him that I gave the OK to max out my $150 to buy contacts. I never said that.\n\nAWFUL. Never again will I go back.

I went for the first time in a long time last night with a few friends and the experience was ice cold.  We go there about 50 minutes before close and were greeted by the manager with no smile and a warning that they closed in 45 minutes.  That being said, all we wanted was a couple drinks and apps.  We did not do any entrees much less any dishes that required any significant time or labor, wings, my bruschetta, and one dessert on top of 3 cocktails.  Server was nice enough and very polite about replacing my first drink which came out in a glass that was nearly cracked in half.  We paid our bill right as they locked doors and let our server clean off our entire table.  We were out on the patio, assuming that it was probably the best place to be if you were going to there a little past close.  Needless to say, the manager on duty came out moments later and proclaimed ""I'm lockin' up.""  with no smile, empathy, remorse, or hospitality.  I understand you are locking the place down for the night AND that I am there past close... but if you want to send the right message... don't be a jerk 15 minutes after you close and literally kick out all of your guests.  There are much more professional and friendly ways to handle that.  Wouldn't mind being asked to leave or step off the patio so they could locked down the store, I am not that difficult. Nor was it even that late.\n\nBoggles my mind, I've worked in this industry for a long enough time to appreciate good service and a nice place.

Then he continued to berate my mother-in-law in the open restaurant regarding how dare anyone talk to him like that. I was within ear shot of the entire conversation, and there was nothing wrong with what she said.\n\nThen Frank, the bartender, continued conversing with a blonde waitress at the bar regarding how they hate when customers tell them something about the restrooms being filthy.\n\nNo patron of a restaurant deserves to be treated like she was. Standard customer service response is simple. ""I'm sorry to hear that. We will have someone check it out as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it to our attention."" Not some tirade over how you don't use the ladies room, that you don't fix restrooms in general, that you won't tolerate being treated that way, and how you are entitled to treat patrons like that if you feel offended that they pointed out that the restroom was broken and unsanitary.\n\nI invited my mother in law and wife to leave the restaurant and tried to no avail to talk Frank out of his self-righteous tree. You simply don't treat customers like that, no matter how much you do not like them.\n\nMy suggestion? This is the worst pay toilet in New Orleans. Other reviews speak to the quality of the food. You be the judge whether you can or can't find 100 better places to eat, drink, or go to the restroom in a 0.2 mile radius.",2011-05-28,01:37:08

WOW, that's descriptive, but true.\n\nI became a sucker to these idiots, or who's the idiot, as they are a door to door, food sales business, and I was outside talking to my neighbor when the CRACK HEADS showed. since they can't be the most reputable company, hence they hire people who look as if just released from prison, only after enjoying the beatings and occasional rape.\n\nThe CRACK HEADs work as a team of Mr. Scum and Mr. Open Sores. they gladly show you pamphlets, tell you there customers and how clean there finger nails are!\n\nOK, apparently me and the neighbor were weakened by the smell of meth and went in half for NY strip steaks. My first thought was to kill myself before the actual purchase. I regret that now. But, experiment is the name of the game. and I had a money back GAR-UN-TEE (sound hillbilly enough) as it said so on the pamphlet.\n\nI took two frozen steaks from the box and defrosted them. once defrosted I cut the plastic cryovacted seal and went to pull it out. What followed were like entrails in an autopsy. A slimy gelatinous goo, with a distinctive chemical oder. Was it formaldehyde a common preservative for lab rats, in your 7th grade biology class, or was t an embalming fluid used to prepare you for your final windowless condo? \n\nMy senses hit me like a European speed train, yes I was taken.....DEE DEE DEE, I know I should get back on the small bus.\n\nOnce realized that I was taken there were two things I had to do! One contact the pamphlet company and get my money back just as they said I would, two experiment with this alien meat (alien as in outer space, not illegally entered in the United States).\n\nI pan cooked the steak, as if I were going to make any NY strip. When done I thought it even smelled normal, but I had the smell of formaldehyde in my nostrils. So I stuck my noise in a coffee can (swear) to burn away the remnants of lab rat! \n\nThe steak still had a funny oder as if this cow had a heart attack in the field and the cow hands came by a few days later with a chain saw to butcher dear old (very old) Bessy!\n\nI had to continue, maybe the fear of a meth laced high was over whelming me, causing me not to think straight. So I needed to bite into it. I didn't even have a red wine reduction or a cream sauce on it. a cut a small piece and bit down!\n\nThe chewing began. it almost had a texture of steak, it almost had a texture of the sole of my shoe too! I chewed and chewed and chewed and chewed, then gave up and swallowed. the taste was now recognizable, SALT! and a whole lot of it. I didn't even salt it. it was as if this was a pre salted cow, I hear there all over Europe and the communists swear by them.\n\nThe gelatinous ooze was a liquid salt solution, used to preserve this disgusting piece of meat! The experiment continued. I got NY strip number two, and removed it from the use and washed off the steak. When I did that the steak instantly went grey! literally went grey. My steak was a mood ring, that was edible, well edible to a maggot!\n\nI didn't salt the washed grey looking steak and tossed it into the pan. The result was the same, except the memories of watching this steak turn grey!\n\nLastly, I called the number on the pamphlet, and it rang and rang and rang, I even walked away from the phone cleaned the living room and came back to rings. The 1-800 to know where! I then went to the internet (the greatest invention ever) and googled them! I number of similar complaints popped up! What a scum, bile eating, slime sucking company. I would like to thank Mr. Scum and Mr. Open Sore, for delivering me back to reality, I don't think they will be treated as kindly next time! \n\nPS, when I spoke to my neighbor again, he said wasn't it terrible, I gave mine to the lawn man, well neighbor, I threw mine away!!!!",2010-07-14,02:05:55

Issue from the time I picked up the the car, the car itself and right now with billing. Still issues with getting to the parking lot and their signage. Car had lights on the dash indicating the tires needed air, and another caution light that was on the entire time. Not very comforting, but I should've returned the car right away. However, I needed to get to my destination. The fuel tank was not full when I picked it up. I returned it full because I was sure they would try to charge me if I didn't. I heard a staff member trying to pressure a woman next to me into paying the fuel charge. The staff member said, ""It's cheap @13.99. The customer kept insisting she was only going a few miles and back, and would only use 1/10 of a tank. I made my reservation through the 800 number because I had trouble online. The customer service rep did tell me she upgraded me at no additional charge. When I picked up the car, the rep had added liability insurance, and I told her I didn't want any of those options. Forget trying to call the location directly. When something picks up on the other line, they ask for a remote access code. Now, I'm trying to reach someone at the main office about billing and customer service. It's Sunday and I was instructed to call tomorrow.

So finally after stretching my neck for 20 mins looking for our server ... i said ""excuse me"" to a server that walked by us ... in a nice sweet tone just to ask for water (we didnt mind waiting to be honest since they were packed anyway) ... but to my shock, the guy snapped at me and said ""WAIT OR GET UP AND LEAVE!"" \n\nSo we left ....! \n\nI have NEVER experienced anything like that!  I will NEVER recommend this place to my friends or to anyone! AT ALL!",2011-04-04,05:05:23

It was held at Fisher's Tudor House on Street Road in Bensalem, which was always the epitome of fine dining in the great northeast, where many years ago I spent my youth.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Fisher's, there used to be several of them. The original was on Castor avenue north of Cottman Avenue and was always quite the place to be. I can remember admiring the huge ancient ship models encased in glass when I was little and my family would make the drive. When I was older, I would have Friday lunch there during work, enjoying the fresh snapper soup and delicious blue cheese dressing. \n\nBut the Tudor House took up the mantle with style. A HUGE facility built (at the time) in the middle of nowhere, it was not only THE seafood restaurant in the area, it had banquet halls for thousands of people, a night club, and everything the fine diner could wish.\n\nReturning to the present, I had arrived early for the party in an effort to beat rush hour traffic. As we talked I realized it had been a good seven years at least since I had last set foot into this facility, so I was looking forward to a trip down memory lane. \n\nWell, as they say, what a long strange trip it's been. We checked in at the front desk of a strangely quiet reception area. The waiting area had a wonderful display of cookies and stuffed animals, but almost appeared to be a gift shop, something out of place among the huge mantles and wallboards decorating the entryways. We passed the wine bins outside one of the main dining rooms and walked into the bar.\n\nMy guest, who smokes like a chimney, was amazed they were ignoring the smoking ban until I reminded him we were in Bensalem. Yours truly, who can smell a pilot light out two houses over, was aghast at the smell of old smoke. No need to bring cigarettes kiddies, just lick a wall. It was like the airport 'smoking rooms' of old. Not even a good wood/leather/smoke mix. Just dirty old smoke.\n\nThe bartended approached us as we sat at the bar (we were the lone patrons as far as the eye could see short of someone who was apparently a dishwasher from the kitchen watching the news), and I ordered a lager while we looked over the bar menu and privately discussed his 80's retro haircut. \n\nLittle did I realize this was a foreshadowing of the night to come, but let's continue.\n\nBMK ordered his typical Malibu and coke and I ordered a half dozen oysters. They were Effingham Bay's, and served in minimum orders of three at $1.50 a piece. \n\nI had switched over to Dirty Skyy Martini's when the oysters arrived. My nose warned me to be careful even as they approached. One sniff and I knew these were off. I tried sniffing each individually but there was no point. BMK remarked that he could smell them and ""if I can smell them, they're really bad."" I agreed and sent them back. They were politely removed from my tab and we continued on, raw bar now on permanent 'avoid' status.\n\nYou can see the menu at their website, but it had truly gone from fine seafood dining to JRZY diner seafood. (And not good JRZY diner seafood, which can be quite nice.) Let me note their advertised 'seafood menu' has only five (yes FIVE) offerings, no lobster (petite lobster tails don't count), and two fresh fish. \n\nWe decided something odd was going on so we quickly drank our drinks, left payment, and walked back out to the entranceway. How shocked was I to see the staff following us out, lights being turned off and doors locked AT NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT!!!. South Jersey isn't this bad on a Sunday night! This was KraZinEss!!!\n\nI mourn for Fisher's. The Grande Dame is dead, and in her place is a gum chewing, belly shirt wearing Jersey girl. Yes, I love Jersey Girls as much as anyone for their candor and love of life, (they're the reason cars have backseats dammit!) but to see such a fine institution reduced to effective culinary rubble just hurts.\n\nGoodbye Fishers! I'm holding off on a final recommendation until my Aunt's 100th birthday in hopes that by then you'll either have returned to grace or shut down. Maybe you'll be a Friday's by then, or perhaps a huge Quizno's, who knows; and sadly, who cares? You've become the once divorced mom, hair dyed too red, drinking and smoking too much, while hitting on anything that looks like it might buy you your next drink. You're best ignored and left to survive in our memories as what you once were. I'll see you in ten years. Perhaps I'll wear my high school varsity jacket to blend in.",2009-04-15,15:06:04

Me thinks maybe, but it makes for fun reading and gets you interested, yes? Anyway, this place is the pits. A cross between a pharmacy and a flea market, make sure to double check expiration dates on everything you buy. Nothing like walking out with a snack that expired last week! Yummers! \n\nStanding alone at the end of the dying three shop strip mall, the only reason this place stays around is because it's close to the Wawa. Let's face it - parking here can be a nightmare, and none of these shops have been renovated since they were built. \n\nNot enough to rate one star you say? Too harsh you exclaim! Well, say that after you get your prescription filled here. I dropped off two prescriptions noting they have a sign, right on the door of the pharmacy consultation area, that tells you they will match any competitor's price on prescriptions. \n\nI happily showed up with my Wegman's circular showing my meds should cost me all of $6, when good old Jackie tells me that sign doesn't apply in New Jersey! What?!? It doesn't say 'except NJ' in microtype anywhere on it as it is RIGHT THERE TO READ and I literally am pointing that fact out to her. On the sign. That is RIGHT THERE. \n\nShe then states that the offer is only for people 65 and older, which is better than not applicable, but still a change from not at all, at which point I smell a rat. I press her on which is it, not at all or 65 and over, she shrugs, stating ""I'm really not sure but either way there's no further discount on your medicine."" \n\nI can't get my script back. I hate this place anyway (I only stopped because it was convenient when I ran in the Wawa for money the other day) so screw it, and her, I'll pay the extra and get on my way. \n\nI advise her that I have no intention of ever returning to this establishment as I consider the sign misleading and her attitude poor. She shrugs, stating ""Yeah, I get yelled at a lot about that sign."" \n\nHere's a hint Jackie - Take the freaking sign down if it doesn't apply. Better than getting sued for false advertising! Sheesh, I know, I can see that shrug all the way from here.

Unfortunately we settled upon Brady's which was billed as having the best BBQ in town.  Being the only BBQ place in town, that claim shouldn't mean much; though it could serve as a grammar lesson since you typically need at least three things to say one of them is the best, but I digress.\n\nWe arrived during the early evening on a Sunday night, were met with slow service, and were informed that about a third of the choices on the menu were no longer available.  Anything popular like ribs, sausage, or potato salad were supposedly sold out hours ago.  As such, I settled on having a pulled pork sandwich and opted in for the optional pickle.  After a fair amount of time, my sandwich and pickle arrived with a bag of Lay's potato chips to boot.  The sandwich was pretty substandard.  The bun did not hold up to the weight of the pork or the added sauce.  It started to pull apart on the bottom and even fall apart, while the top remained intact and relatively pristine.  It soon became too messy to eat, so I had to resort to using a fork.  If I had known, I would have just ordered the platter instead.  The pork tasted of fat, but was otherwise a bit bland.  I had a choice of three sauces and found that the spicy sauce helped the best.  I worked through it.  It was displeasing and less than memorable or more accurately memorable for all of the wrong reasons, but I finished it.\n\nAs we were waiting for the check, I noticed a kid sitting across from me chowing down on some delicious looking ribs.  What the hell???  Weren't they sold out of these?  We asked our waitress about this.  With a deer in the headlights pose, she muttered something about ""well, you know, they are slow cooked so..."".  She then immediately realized that she needed to be somewhere else and sped off.  Between us, we couldn't figure out what her explanation meant.  I am guessing they didn't want us to tie up the table for an hour waiting on the next batch of ribs, so they just said they were out of them.  At any rate, the service here is definitely unprofessional.  Worse, out of all the BBQ places I have been to around the country, this is the first one that ever ran out of food or had food shortage issues.  Poor management all around.

First off, the website did have the new menu but also the bar menu which had some favorites including nachos (one of the reasons why we came so often).  My husband's french dip was okay but a little burned on the outside and the cheese didn't seem to jive with the rest of the sandwich.  I ended up with a southwest salad, which was good, but when I came for the nachos, it lacked some excitement.  It was also quite small for ten dollars and lacked some flavor.

It's too bad, because some of the food was actually good.\n\nFirst, we had to snake back and forth in a queue-holding labyrinth of ropes to get a wristband. Why? Nobody was ever able to explain it. If you paid for admission to the museum, you got a sticker. So what was the point of having a wristband for attendees who chose NOT to buy admission? Better to just allow us to go straight into the food truck rally without setting us up for future hair-pulling when it came time to remove the damn thing. Infuriating bureaucracy is not the first impression your event ought to make.\n\nSecond, the rally was on fairly uneven ground -- patches of sand, patches of grass, some level, some (near a playground) almost comically dippy. It was damn near impossible to get anywhere with a wheelchair except by going backwards and hoping we didn't run anyone over. If you try to roll over this awful terrain facing forward, your front casters will literally plow into the soil. There are commercially available surfaces you can install to make wheelchair users happy without reducing the permeability of the ground, and a science museum ought to be leading the way on stuff like this. (And a very special ""screw you too"" to the vendor who brought a two-level stainless steel staircase to help able-bodied customers, but didn't bring a ramp.)\n\nThird, someone seems to have gotten the terms ""food truck rally"" and ""monster truck rally"" mixed up, given the noise level from the engines and the unnecessarily loud sound system in the concrete echo chamber that held the very few available tables.\n\nFourth, even though most trucks routinely sell reasonably priced drinks, they were absolutely prohibited from doing so, because MOSI wanted a monopoly. And boy, did they ever exploit it (and us). The last time I paid $2 for a 12-ounce bottle of water, I was on a cruise ship. Yeah, it's that bad. I tried to buy a 16-oz bottle of Aquafina from the mixed drinks table, but the guy behind the bar said ""Soft drinks are over there"" and then turned his back on me to make sure I got the point that I wasn't welcome.\n\nFinally, some vendors just couldn't keep up with even the number of people who attended despite all these issues. One kept me waiting for 15 minutes for two baskets of cheesesteak fries, and started issuing warnings to new customers walking up that the wait would be 20 minutes. Jeez, guy, if you had warned ME it was going to take 15 minutes, I would have gone elsewhere.\n\nThere were a few vendors I'd love to patronize again in a parking lot, where wheelchairs roll smoothly and no monopoly prevents reasonably priced drinks, but I wouldn't come back to a MOSI food truck rally under these circumstances even if the food were free.",2013-10-07,13:15:42

Despite having been there over an hour our drinks were only replenished ONCE, while it only took 5 minutes to drink them...the rest of the time our glasses sat empty at the edge of the table. HINT!

Just envision a kitchen that isn't a kitchen, but a room with multiple fryer stations and freezers.\n- aloof, forced, unfriendly, repeatedly forgetful service both from waitstaff and bartenders.  \n- A generic atmosphere and ambiance with lots of plasma TV's strewn everywhere and beige as far as the eye can see.\n- Cheap domestic draft beers, if you're on a tight budget and don't mind drinking Miller Lite, their pitchers are $5!  You can't beat that deal anywhere.\n- Crowd content varies, although I'd avoid this place during the weekend at all costs\n\nCame in with a group when the restaurant was rather empty, the staff was not very helpful or accommodating - the bartenders would not spare any high chairs for our table nor did the restaurant have any extra chairs for a big top.  \n\nStaff struck me as rude while no one really seemed to care or to try to solve the issue.

I should have walked right away!\n\nSo the deal at the time was $99 to sign up and $59.99 a month thereafter.  I am an avid reader of contracts, and I pointed out the many loopholes to them before signing it.  I was assured it was a very casual contract, they were a neighborhood business, and they weren't going to screw anyone over.  What a convincing little song and dance.  Well, I believe in giving people (especially neighbors, and so called ""neighborhood businesses"") the benefit of the doubt, so I signed up because they were conveniently located and had yoga classes.  And for 6 months, I happily went to my yoga classes and paid my bills.  \n\n...Until one day I come in and find out it's going to cost an additional $10 a month (in the middle of my contract!!) to continue to attend those yoga classes.  Pretty shady, right?  Whatev.  Since they bailed on their own contract, all I want is a refund of the initiation fee, and a refund of the last 39 days I'd prepaid upon signing up back in December.  They've decided to ignore that request.  The excuses they've given me on the phone are piss-poor, and one member of their staff even got verbally abusive on the phone.  \n\nI highly recommend you check out the neighborhood message board, northernliberties.org, before considering a membership here.  I'm not the only one to complain (just the first one on Yelp, for some reason).  Here's one recent thread in particular: http://pub50.bravenet.com/forum/4226496069/show/637106\n\nIf City Fitness does the right thing and refunds my money (and reconsiders cheating its members in this manner) I would update my rating to 3 stars.  There are a lot of excellent things about this gym, and there are a lot of things that leave a foul taste in your mouth.  Here's the short list: \n\nThe good: \n- Many of the yoga teachers, including Lisa, Kelly and Mark, are fabulous and I miss them.  \n- The TVs & vents atop each aerobic machine are nice \n- The overall gym vibe is nice, full of neighbors, not meatheady\n\nThe bad: \n- The gym has some cleanliness issues.  Yes it is new so it looks new, but get close up to a yoga mat: they don't get scrubbed down and you can smell an interesting, unique sweat bouquet on each one.  Dust bunnies float about like tumbleweed, too.  The bathrooms are often out of toilet paper and I used a shower once and told myself never again, ew.  A professional cleaning company really needs to be hired here.  \n- When machines break, they should be fixed promptly.  Some of the treadmills were very shaky.  Some of the TVs and air vents don't work. \n- The nickel-and-diming across the board is very annoying.  How about providing towels for the prices we are paying?  Or the full shampoo/soap/conditioner range in the showers?  And the website still says a juice bar is ""coming soon.""  I was told it was ""coming soon"" in December and it's still not been worked on.  Oh, and the tanning bed costs extra?  They should clearly state what is covered in a membership before people sign up.  Because all things (that you don't know up front) considered, it's not that great a deal. \n\nSigh.  Now to find another yoga place.",2008-07-29,15:22:18

I mean I REALLLLLLY wanted to like Sunday's.  \n\nI had the opportunity to check in on a Saturday night and then I was also scheduled for a birthday brunch the next day. \n\nI have two seperate events I will describe. \n\nFirst, the Saturday night adventure. We had reservations for the evening and when we arrived, there were a few tables in there but the place was not busy yet. \n\nWe get service from a waiter who was already scattered and overwhelmed. Not sure why, as it was not very busy.  He takes our drink orders and we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them.   We can see them sitting there getting watered down for like 15 minutes.   I was tempted to grab them off the bar but I wanted to see what the issue was.  Well, I would have asked HIM but he never returned.  So a female server comes to the next table.   They are complaining they ordered their cocktails about 15 mins ago and asked her if she could check on them. \n\nI sorta piped in from my table and stated we were also waiting for ours. \n\nShe came back and delivered everyones drinks.  Still - our waiter is a miss. Yet I have seen take care of like 3 tables that have since come in after us and who are getting appetizers already. Us... well we haven't ordered. \n\nSo then about 40+ minutes, he comes to us as we are done with the small bread basket and says our meals will be right up and takes our menus.   WHOA - We are WAITING for YOU to take our order. \n\nSo table next to us is complaining and I was fed up but not rude. \n\nOwners lady/server comes over and is very nice and takes care of things. \n\nShe states that since they just won Best of The Bay in CL - they were not prepared to be so busy. \n\nI totally understand that but then you should have stopped with the 40 other people coming in if you couldn't handle the 25 already in there. \n\nFood - by the time we received it was ok. Not bad, but after waiting an hour, we were scarfing it down to catch our concert. \n\nI had a salad. Fresh but barely any dressing. \nI had the mussels and frittes app as a dinner with the salad. Would have been decent but was fed up at that point. \n\n-----  So then we left.  I was apprehensive about returning the next day but owners lady/server who was very nice made sure to let me know they would be FULLY staffed the following day and she guaranteed a better experience. \n\nSo Sunday come's....   We have a large table (about 12-14 people). I have a feeling that Dugg (review below) came in when we were there. There were actually two large parties that day. \n\nThe wait was crazy for people who came in even tho there were plenty of tables. They couldn't handle the amount of guests. \n\nFood for breakfast was subpar. Overcooked eggs, greasy bacon, super hard foccaccia as the base for the benedict.   Another bad day. \n\nSo I chalk a lot up to the place being very overwhelmed while they are experiencing growing pains.  They are not able to handle the customers that are coming in with one cook.   \n\nI would call this place Sunday's Dining and NOT Sunday's Fine Dining until they can work out the kinks.   There were a LOT of unhappy people on both experiences. \n\nFrom other reviews, I think the place has definite potential but I just think they need to get in a groove. I MAY (or may not) try them again in a few months but for right now, I would rather go elsewhere when I am in Ybor.",2011-09-30,23:00:56

It was very stormy that evening (we're talking wrath of God) and we had wisely chosen the outdoor seating.  Despite the hailstones and fear of electrocution, we were hopeful for the best of evenings.  Unfortunately, the service was almost rudely slow and very inconsistent.  Despite the fact that our party comprised at least 75% of the customers present, it took 30-45 minutes to get my drink and for us to place our orders.  For some reason, they were seemingly out of every other thing I attempted to order.  I quit counting and tried to mask my irritation with copious amounts of (my own $4 corkage fee) rum , so I have no idea the eons that passed before we received our food.  The juice was stale and overpriced.  The tortilla of my $11 pseudo-roti had the weird taste of post-freezerburn thaw.  The staff insisted on playing this boombox that kept cutting out and skipping, further adding to the ambiance.  And to add insult to the injury of endless waiting and mostly mediocre food, I was forced to pay my mandatory 20% on top of my already unjustly steep bill.

I went to the hostess station and then tried to sit where the Giants game would be on. Strangely enough that a place with at least 50 TVs in all kinds of locations wouldn't have at least one TV withy game on. The manager comes over and explains that TV are first come first serve. So instead of trying to accommodate me and my party he basically told me to get lost. I responded that I waited patiently for a table so now I should get a TV with my game on. He says it doesn't work that way. I said if I wait for a table then he should find a way to make it happen. Instead of trying to he tells me that's not what he is going to do.

We sat in the second room and ordered the jalapeño pineapple margaritas - you would expect at least some spice from this drink. Nope- even when we asked for more of the jalapeño syrup it didn't help. Giving them the benefit we ordered a third one with muddled Jalapeño just didn't hit the mark. Fine I can handle a non spicy drink. Now we started with some cold bar seafood. TERRIBLE. The oysters were not shucked properly, no small fork to assist. The jumbo shrimp were BAD. BUT after that the stone crab claws were slimy and smelled nasty.

And if there was one on the wall out in the open like that, who knows what the kitchen looks like.   Seems like a visit from the county is in order.

I'm serious folks, it was down right rude, made me feel like a clown and was the beginning of the most absurd service I have ever experienced.\n \nWe sat at least 20-30 minutes waiting for menus, while hubby stewed watching others being serviced and finally received our Yelp appetizer which was one large ( Diver, I'm assuming ) scallop each, wrapped in practically raw bacon on a small bed of baby spinach leaves. The scallop was cooked perfectly, I gave hubby my bacon, but he and I both agreed it was too raw to eat and then we were handed menus, which was a good forty minutes after we had been seated.\n \nWe shared the most bland bowl of lobster bisque that was served in a cool tureen style crock, absolutely no hint of sherry and I used to love their bisque, our waiter brought us a hot pepper sherry sauce in a bottle, but we passed, as it was very hot and the sherry did not even attempt to shine through.\n \nThe large oyster Rockefeller were outstanding, the escargot were tender and swimming in a garlic sauce with baby mushroom caps and a thick slice of grilled bread to dip into the sauce. The jumbo lump crab cake was large and pure but very un-adventurous other than that and was served with a lousy cocktail sauce. I had to giggle silently as the table next to us commented on their choice of sauce to serve with a lump crab cake. I myself had asked for the mustard sauce that was previously mentioned in their crab claw appetizer and it worked to help.\n \nWhen our meals came our server finally grabbed my hubby's longtime empty coke glass and refilled it and asked if I would like anything else. I asked what chardonnay they had by the glass, he offered several, not mentioning the names but the regions and I chose a Sonoma, when he brought it he had the label totally covered and poured me a sip, I asked to see the label and I was thrilled to see that it was Sonoma Cutre, one of my favorites and then he was about to walk away when I said excuse me, can you please pour my glass of wine? Oops.\n \nHubby was served a huge roast of Prime rib and he was kind enough to cut the bones off first to save for my onion soup for Christmas, his meat was cooked to perfection, tender, flavorful and juicy, however my filet was a big let down and we had already spent so much time there and just wanted to leave. I had ordered it medium rare and when I cut into the first third of it, the first cut was medium well, no pink or red whatsoever, but the center of the steak was barely pink.\n \nI was not going to say anything, but for a dry, flavorless piece of meat at $38.00 and the thinnest, un-flavorful bearnaise sauce I have ever been served, I thought this is so wrong, class or not speak up. I did and he argued with me! He said well the outer edges will be well done, I had cut one third into my steak, come on buddy this is not the first place I have had a steak is what I wanted to say, but instead I showed him the center and said it is barely a hint of pink and even the top and bottom of that was well done!\n \nTo be continued in another update, this is how upsetting this dining experience was.",2010-12-28,16:20:17

I checked out and the guy handling the front desk said that he was going to charge me for another entire nights stay for being 30 minutes late, $250.  I informed him that the race wouldn't release any of the bikes until noon, and that we called, but could not get a signal on our cell because of the thousands of people the were at the race, most likely on their cell phones.  When I told this to the front desk guy, and also told him that my wife was pregnant, so it took us a little longer to check out.  He said that he didn't care if my wife was pregnant.

(we had to send it back once, but they were very nice about re-doing the dish). the crabcake was fine, but completely unmemorable in any way, which in some respects made it the highlight of the meal. \n\nthe service overall was fine. our server was very attentive and nice. it WAS a bit off-putting when he spent a while speaking very disparagingly about restaurant week and how 'just any restaurant gets to participate anymore' which seemed very strange to lacking in any kind of self-awareness.",2011-09-22,14:13:26

When I lived in Noblesville a long time ago, I used to come down here and mail Christmas packages in late December. There is always a wait here; December, June, October... it doesn't matter, its all season inefficient.\n\nI went last week to buy the new Peanuts stamps - so cool. I said I wanted 10 books and they had only 1 (that's right, one single book of these stamps). I was told I could get the Peanuts stamps out of the kiosk. Being a little cautious, I plugged in a payment for 3 books. Sure enough, they were not books at all, but instead a single Charlie Brown stamp repeated over and over. Just then a supervisor or manager came out and asked me if I got what I wanted, I said no and explained the difference between a multi-image book and a repeating sequence of the exact same stamp. The individual clearly had no idea what I was talking about. I left immediately. You'd think the post office would have a clue about philately. I left and went to the post office in Nora where they had loads of Peanuts books. \n\nDuring the same trip, I asked if they had forever international stamps. These cool stamps are round and will take your card or letter anywhere in the world for $1.20. Answer from the Bash Street Post Office: ""We don't have any, they haven't sent us any yet..."" Check. \n\nLast year I sent a package to Mexico. I used a form provided by the Bash Post Office. When I went to drop it off at a different location, I had to re-do the form because the one given to me by Bash Street PO was out of date - it had been discontinued over a year before.\n\nLast spring, (true story) I was attacked in the lobby by a woman who was screaming at her mom on her mobile about some bills she had just picked up at her post office box.

But in this case, it's more than merited. \n\nWe strolled through the French Market in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, and it was fairly busy, but definitely not overcrowded. My wife and I wanted to try something authentically New Orleans, so we chose the N'awlins Cafe. They were serving all sorts of Cajun/Creole food, and had tons of pictures with celebrities eating there, so we felt good about the decision. \n\nBoy were we wrong.\n\nWe ordered our food, gumbo and a burger, after a few minutes of sitting down. I waited 5 minutes before having to go to the bathroom (it WAS Mardi Gras, right?). So I trekked the 5 or so blocks back, waited in line, yadda yadda yadda, and walked back. All of that taking about 20 minutes. No food had arrived. Right when I got back, two women sat next to us and ordered. As we waited longer and longer, food was flying out of the kitchen. After another 10-15 minutes, the people next to us who had ordered when I got back, received their food. Finally my wife said something, and after re-taking our order it seemed, the food came out of the kitchen after another 5 minutes. All in all about 30-40 minutes of waiting for already cooked gumbo and a burger. \n\nI can usually forgive things like that, had they said it was busy, that they'd forgotten the ticket, or whatever the case might be. \n\nBut what can't be forgiven is the taste of the food, which was the worst that I had in 4 days in New Orleans. The gumbo was a tiny portion for $7, watery, and with an inedible skinny crab claw on top. My wife's burger was a downright disgrace though. I can make a better burger with a frozen patty from Costco. It was miniature in size, and about as hard as a frisbee.

He did not say anything to us, just dropped off the water and left.  Several minutes passed before a incredibly disinterested waiter came over to take our orders.

The sides of rice and grilled vegetables were tasteless however.  My guest's fillet and shrimp was even smaller!  The shrimp was good, but you only get three of them.  The fillet was incredibly tender, but mostly flavorless.  My guest's sides were grilled vegetables and sweet potato mash.  The vegetables were again tasteless, but the sweet potatoes were incredibly sweet.  \n\nIn the hour and a half we spent at the restaurant, our server only refilled our water glasses once and was only at our table a total of five times!

There is a nightclub below the hotel.\n\nWe go up to the second floor reception area where we are greeted by a staff member who checked us in.  We noted while in the reception area that the ""house music"" could still be heard.  Then we noted that our room was on the second floor.  We asked if the sound could be heard in the room and was told that it could - but the hotel was full and it was only room left.  He went on to say that there was nothing they could do about as it was a 'lease issue'.\n\nReally?\n\nWhile the room is decorated nicely and the hotel has a cool vibe to it - I don't understand the practice of selling a space to sleep for several hundred dollars that is surrounded by a street corner, nightclub and elevator.  We were unable to go to sleep until after 2am (on a Tuesday evening) when the DJ and his musical skills ended - at which point we then were able to hear the street (and the hookers on the corner) as well as the ice maker and elevator in the hall.\n\nAt check in we were told the business center was on the fourth floor - I was tempted to take my pillow and blanket and head there for some sleep.  I am sure it would be more quiet.  Perhaps management could consider turning room 201 into the business center instead of charging people for such a disasasterous night's sleep.  And by sleep, I mean tossing and turning and praying you can ignore the ""last call"" from below.....\n\nNever again.

The starter also known as the soup seems to be a out of the can Campbell soup with a few chickpeas thrown in to make it seem exotic.  Its very high in sodium and was served at room temperature. 1 hour later, comes the second course which is a cold salad with carrots and cucumbers.  At this point we were starved but the carrots had the taste of pesticides and dirt.  There were no utensils given and bread was passed out as if it was a scene from Oliver twist and we were begging to receive more stale bread.  Next the Bastilla, this was a pastry stuffed with chicken topped off with powdered sugar. The pastry was fried in oil that was past its prime and the stuffing inside was tasteless and greasy.  30 minutes later the main course came...  which was a full chicken that was greasy over cooked  and came with no utensils.  After asking countless time for forks, water and bread the waiter decided to reward us with some lukewarm water and a few forks and some more stale bread.

Our visit started off with a long wait for a server but it was busy and we were excited! About 20 minutes into the meal the building began testing their fire alarm. It was so loud that it was painful and several in our party went outside for a reprieve. We came back to lukewarm food and confirmed that it would not happen again. To reiterate, this was fire alarm *testing*, not a false alarm. They knew it was happening and should have suspended service for that hour.\n\nThe testing continued and half of our party had to sit outside in the pouring rain while the restaurant continued with service as if there was nothing wrong and guests were furious. Food continued to get delivered and when we returned in between alarm tests it was ice cold. We asked to speak with the manager and we watched him go hide in the back. Between our whole party we own four restaurants and it was one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen.\n\nIn the end the manager finally came out after repeated requests and apologized but did absolutely nothing for us despite the fact that we didn't consume 50% of our meal and we were soaked from sitting in the rain.

It is not at all surprising that Sears/Kmart are in big trouble financially.  The shopping center is confusing and could really use a few stop signs here and there to improve traffic flows and safety.  The store is disorganized and not well lit.  You often find an item with no price tag anywhere.  Was it suppose to be here or was this lonely object randomly placed here by employees or shoppers?  Who knows?  There are a lot of stuff on shelves/racks in the middle of the aisles. There is no logic in how the items are organized.   Its like a thrift shop, the dollar store, or a garage sale.   The lines are long and the cashiers move like molasses.  Just think of the efficiency you see at Costco, and now picture the exact opposite happening at Kmart.  \n\nThe so call shop your way reward system is just more trouble than it is worth.  If you have credit in the account, It is not automatically credited toward your purchase.  You have to ask everytime and you have to input a pin number just to use it.  Anyone remember that?  I don't think so since no sane individual would regularly subject herself to the Kmart shopping experience.  \n\nOnce, I even had a cashier who specifically ask me if I want to know how much is in my rewards account.  She then looked it up and told me the number, something like 15 cents.  When I looked at my receipt later, the credit was not applied to my purchase.  Well, why the hell did you go through all that trouble if it is not going toward my purchase?  Oh yeah, she would need the stupid pin number to use it.  Along with the question of ""would you like me to see how much is in your account?"", this particularly friendly cashier also had a repertoire of other questionnaires.  ""Would you like the receipt printed or emailed?"", ""Would you like just the receipt or the receipt with all the coupons?"", ""Would you like to donate to St. Jude?"", ""Would you like to apply for a credit card?"", ""Would you like this in a bag?""...Gahh, maybe that's why the line moves like molasses.",2013-10-23,23:45:37

Common sense would say that the waitress would not blow off said group and put the orders in for us since we are being forced to pay a gratuity. Common sense would also say that the owner of the restaurant should step in at some point and be helpful in trying to help the customers move on with their days. And common sense would say that if you are capable of charging over 12 individual cards a portion of the bill then you owe it to them to make their life easier and split the damn bill. Their excuse was that big parties normally give in and just have one person pay for the entire bill, I'm assuming they get home and go insane from trying to figure out how much they owe the individual. \n\nAs a side note, their women's restroom door for some reason slams, so be careful ladies when you leave.",2011-11-23,07:30:51

We went over around 7:30pm and asked the hostess for a seat on the front patio. \n\nHere's the interesting part, a group of 4 was not large enough to seat at any of their 6-person tables of which there were at least 6 available, already set and ready to go. We were told that we could wait 15-20 minutes and, if there were still tables available, that they would seat us. They referred to the tables as being reserved and when asked told us that they weren't reserved by anyone but rather that they were holding them in case larger groups arrived... and wanted to sit outside in 90 degree muggy weather... when there was a festival with music playing at the other end of downtown.\n\nTo be fair, there were a few 4-person tables on the patio but all were taken... including one with only one person lounging with his feet on the chair next to him with an empty glass and a newspaper. When asked why he was allowed a four-person table the answer was simply that they didn't have smaller tables. Wtf!?! Don't tell us that 4 people isn't satisfactory for seating at a 6-top but that you'll happily seat one guy not even drinking or eating at a 4-top. And for the record, the single person seating on a night that you are turning people away is at the bar!!!!\n\nWe waited around long enough for me to talk with a manager and ask for a little sympathy and he basically told me to shove off if I didn't like the way the hostess handled things. Done and done Schlafly Bottleworks. I will personally never bother you again with my money. Being a brewery in St. Louis is hardly a unique offering. There are plenty of great options and you just lost 4 customers who apparently fail to meet your seating-eligible requirements.

First, as others have already mentioned, they blasted some folks on Facebook for giving a ""horrible"" review; however, said review was never found, as this business owner is of the kind that just deletes what she doesn't like or what doesn't go with her grain. Secondly, after deleting the review, she then posts some email exchanges that clearly show the people's names/emails. Honestly, there was nothing diabolical about it; just typical exchange of what a business can or cannot offer, then some anger from the customer as the business wouldn't offer those services. All around, that should have been DONE. Like done done, because to me -- outside looking in -- that's a normal occurrence for any business. However, for whatever reason, this business owner and her ""they don't like me, so I'm super mad"" mentality blasted these people on Facebook.\n\nApparently, she was expecting, YET AGAIN, to get people to pat her ego and give her a bunch of ""atta girls"" and 'Likes' of affirmation that she and her business are phenomenal. That's not how it went down, because most people are logical thinkers and not of the coddling nature -- or so I'd like to believe. So, when she was deservedly told how wrong it was of her under her business pseudonym to just blast people, she then chose to retort back of how those people are wrong and how awful those people are for even suggesting such a thing.\n\nAfter 70+ comments of disapproval, it got to the point where the business owner deleted the whole string (predictable, right?) and then turns to Yelp!, where she is now affronting on those that write similar reviews to this one, no doubt.\n\nBUT! That still was not enough to get me to write this review. Because, I get it, we all have bad days -- she had an especially bad one with many bad decisions made; but that doesn't warrant me to -- what she hypocritically coined as 'social media bullying' -- join in and state my piece.\n\nHowever, when I decided to scroll through these other reviews, I was astonished (not really) to see that this wasn't just an off day.

I don't give 1 star reviews lightly, but I just can't recommend it.  The food is OK, but 755 calories for the house salad with grilled chicken and honey mustard dressing, and 1260 calories for their chicken finger plate is a bit much.  They need to work on their healthy options a bit harder.\n\nIf you like fried chicken and don't mind the calorie overdose, then give them a shot. Me I personally prefer Popeye's if I'm going to sin like that, but that's just a personal taste preference of mine.  I also was not terribly impressed with their deep fryer.  The fries were a bit soggy. I guess I am spoiled by Taste of Boston which has what is in my opinion the best deep fryer in Tampa Bay.\n\nPlease understand I am not opposed to consuming 1200 calories in a single meal.  However, with that kind of budget there are just too many other choices I'd personally select.  And I like having the option of going light, but even the grilled chicken salad is a bit rich for me, mostly because I'm a breadaholic and don't have the willpower to turn down the Texas toast.  I hope they consider healthier options to be had with their fried pickels.  I mean, fried food once in a while and in moderation is good for the soul!",2012-01-23,15:22:57

I immediately ask him to suggest the best thing on the menu. Often thins is the first thing on the menu.  He avoids the question.  I ask him other questions and each time he avoids answering.  If you wonder I work in an atmosphere where concise effective communication is key.  I'm ordering lunch, not out to discuss whatever you want to bounce around.  After a whole hoopla he asks if I'm hungry, I say yes, and suggests the Vegetarian Couscous, fine.  They make it, it takes too long because there is now a line and the coordination inside the truck is lacking.  The taste of the couscous is lacking depth and the vegetables are of strange consistencies.  Do not like at all, very mediocre, ESPECIALLY for that price!  Although I've never made couscous I've tried many couses and am sure  I could do just as well if not better on my first time.\nThe second time I patronized Chez Yasmine I purchased the Swedish Salmon Smörgås.  It was one delicious sandwich, but it took 15 minutes to make!!!  It was also very small and cost more than twice the cost of a whole loaf of the bread.  When ordered I guess I didn't account for the extra time it takes to put caviar and capers on wheat bread....  On top of that Jihed stops making my sandwich to take pictures of his customers.  I find this incredibly strange to the point that it kind of scares me.  I wouldn't mind an explanation from any employee associated with the buisness to explain the situation to me because my imagination has run away with the possibilities.  The fact that the owner takes pictures of his customers with his DSLR and the reasons below are my main motivations to discontinue my patronage of Chez Yasmine.\n\n\nOwner Jihed, here's what it comes down to: Your cart is too expensive, the portions are too small, and the dishes are too hard to make causing your customers to wait too long.",2012-02-07,16:23:21

It leaves one with the sense of being purposefully ignored and sets the pace for the meal.  The food is not bad, but barely worth the price (start with a Sashimi Dinner at $40).  If you are coming for lunch, there IS a small slip of paper they will give you for a short-list bento box option.  That is all there is off the regular menu and quite frankly not worth the bother.

Wrong!\n\nWe arrived just in time to catch a game recently and found an empty table -- plenty of empty tables. Despite having been acknowledged when we walked in the door, we had to wait a while for a server. It seemed that there was some sort of controversy with an older man who looked like the owner or manager, as he kept giving us stink eye. \n\nWe finally flagged down the waitress and asked her for menus as we proceeded to order beers (unfortunately not a great beer selection -- and no AZ breweries at all). After taking our order and consulting again with the older man, the waitress delivered all of our beers and told my wife and I that only one of us was allowed to drink. This is apparently their policy for parents, which seems a little excessively nannyish.\n\nNot wanting to inconvenience the rest of our group, we said we would go along with this policy, but didn't agree with it... nor did we agree that we should have been allowed to order and then have the rules change (or rather have the rules dictated to us as though we had done something wrong). Our friends, however, all agreed with us and decided that we should hasten our exit. Meanwhile, the owner/manager/old guy stared us down some more.... so we confronted him and confirmed that he was the owner.\n\nWhen asked what his problem was, the owner/old guy responded in a high pitched and defensive voice that there was no problem at all, before explaining that there was in fact a problem. It went downhill from there..... Apparently, he was worried for our son -- not that our son had done anything terribly wrong, but this guy worried greatly about his safety. We reminded him how awkward and uncomfortable his ""concern"" was, which is when he pulled out his heavy artillery..... He pointed out that our son was crawling on the floor earlier (which we also didn't like, but it's tough keeping a child occupied while staff is reviewing whether or not to offer service). He took it a step further to ask us if we had considered that our son could lose an appendage.... Ummm, no, we don't usually think in those terms.... And that's when he flashed his hand in the air with missing fingers and explained that he had lost his fingers as a child (presumably because of neglectful parenting and maybe bars -- must have somehow been related). Blam! There was the hand, right in our faces! It was uncomfortable, to say the least, so we simply expressed condolences for this man's missing appendage(s) and reminded him that we didn't need to feel harassed any further. We then left and swore to never ever return.",2012-01-09,04:57:23

When we finally went over to inspect the damage, they wanted money. Well, that was my insurance company's job. I got the agent on the phone and the guy at Lott's argued with him and finally let me see my car, collect possessions, and sign a form to have it released to the auto body.\n\nThey're understaffed and were bossing a young woman around when we arrived.

It's five PM on a Saturday with several parties already waiting (should have been a red flag, but I'm from out of town so I overlooked this oddity). We get a buzzer and over the 30 minute wait watch maybe one or two tables leave the dining room. The lobby fills up.\n\nNow, it seems that there was a staffing issue this evening and they were short on servers. I get it. More than 50% of their tables were unseated. However, the remaining staff were unable to manage or compensate for the issues that arose.\n\nOur party got missed. We had two small children with us who, fortunately for everyone around, kept their cool and were amazing over the 2+ hour ordeal that was our dining experience. \n\nHowever, once the seating issue was being addressed, it took several missteps to actually get us a table. Snappy employees, communication issues, and clear disorganization finally resolved and resulted in a table. The manager was quite apologetic, but that was the extent of it. The adults in our group all bailed on the meals we intended to get (which would have amounted to a much larger bill) because everything just felt tense and our kids were losing their shit. One in our group was talked into the endless shrimp yet never offered any extra servings. \n\nApologies are fine for minor inconveniences (and everyone there that night was inconvenienced). However, when those minor inconveniences also involve additional oversights and snappy interactions in front of customers, you do something a bit more than just apologize to make it right. I'm not even implying a discount/comp -- even just getting some sort of food out ASAP for the kids would have been a nice acknowledgement of the delay.\n\nAnd Red Lobster as a Corp really needs to stop serving Kraft Mac and Cheese.

We walked up nicely and asked the status of our order. The employee looked at us confused. She said she didn't take our order? WHAT?!?! You're the only FB behind the counter and there is only 2 of you taking orders! She then said she gave the order to another employee to pull who said she didn't and she was working the fries. \n\nBy then there was a frenzy and a manager came over and tried to sort out the situation. She then asked what we ordered, grabbed our food and sent us on our way. The burgers were barely wrapped, totally half-assed. And the nuggets were cold, she even gave us the wrong sauce! Oh yeah they limit 3 packages for 20 piece nuggets and $0.11 for every additional packet.\n\nOverall, my ""fast food"" experience at McDonald's was the worst of all my fast food experiences!

Don't bother trying to call in an order, it's nearly impossible to communicate with the proprietor when you're standing right in front of her.

The bed in the room was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The beds at most Hilton properties blow this away.

My wife calls down to verify that this place does, in fact, take passport photos before we head down since its on the other side of town. My wife is an Aussie and she unsurprisingly has an accent, which might explain the following conversation, were it not for a key point in her first statement (pay attention--there will be a quiz later). The following conversation ensues: \n\n(My wife) My husband needs to renew his US passport, do you take passport photos?\n(Employee - in angry tone) Yes, but only for American passports. \n(My wife) Ok we will be right down. \n(Employee - still pissy) Fine, but just for American passports. \n\nSheesh. You'd think the fact that my wife asked about a US passport would be a clue, but apparently the accent was too much for this genius to process. Needing the photos, and undaunted, we ventured down to South Reno. We walk in and there is one customer there and a handful of bored looking employees. An employee (clearly the one from the phone) comes up to help. I tell her I am here to get a passport photo. She runs through the ""we only do US passport photos"" schpeel again and I rush her along as that's what I need. She fumbles with the camera, take a photo and then says it will be 2-3 minutes and proceeds to head back behind the counter. \n\nSeemingly bored with me she sends some other poor schmuck out to retrieve the photos. He picks up the camera and sighs. The ""American passport"" woman has taken a giant photo of me, not the two head shots I need for the passport, so we must repeat the process. He gets ready to take another picture and the camera fails. Tries again. Fails. Finally on the third try it works. Three minutes later, I am handed my mugshot--worse than any driver's license photo I've had. Ever. I briefly think of making him retake it, but can't be bothered. I'll spend the next DECADE staring at this sucker. Having to go through the mess again is that bad. But wait, we aren't done. They then ring me up (American passport woman returns to do the honors) and it costs--wait for it--$13.95. Yes a full $14 for two tiny head shots.

For a 4 star hotel, it does not hold the standard of one. I hope management can address these details following: \n\n1. Cleaning room :We left our room this morning to go about our day and used the cleaning service for basic bed making and general cleaning of our bathroom. We came back to our room, FIRST, we found our door was unlocked! It was not fully closed, and I was scared our stuff was stolen. Luckily not. SECOND, our bed was not fully made. Our covers were just moved to hide its use from the previous night, but no tucks or smoothing. THIRD, house cleaning left one of the cleaning bottle in the bathroom sink.I have my beauty products on the counter of the sink. I'm not sure if they were contaminated with the content of the cleaning bottle, but this experience raises a concern with me. The attention to detail needs to be addressed when cleaning the room. \n\n2. Customer service for the show: I attended the show Fancy. When I called to reserve advance tickets for the show, no one picked up. I went to front desk to inquire further about how to get advance tickets since no one picked up. I was told to go directly to the show and address this with the ticket office of the show. I approached the ticket sales and I was told I would not be able to purchase the advance tickets. Why? Im still trying to buy them before the show. What is the time limit for advance tickets. I gave up and just paid for the ""at door"" price. Once we purchases the ticket, I entered the club area. I felt discriminated! I asked the men in black who I assumed were ushers/security guard to help us find a seat. I was told there are no seats for you. Really? In a place full of lounge seats with no one sitting there, I can't sit anywhere? It is because I'm a short Asian? Why are other people being able to be seated?

Displeased, we requested to have new butter. Maybe it was an overlooked item even though the place was NOT busy. It took 15 mins to get a replacement butter and it was this yellow sauce - think cheese whiz - that was cold and still tasting like old fryer oil. It took the server 15 mins to deliver this disastrous mess of ""butter"" because he had to take an order for a larger group before handling our situation. (wtf) There were many employees who could have delivered yet noone was communicating with each other as the crab got cold while we waited. \n\nWhen a manager was requested, it took her 20 mins to show up. Seriously, WTF? That was the last straw. I wasn't even hungry because I was so frustrated. \n\nI can't even remember having such horrible dining experience in my life. No exaggeration - my entire life. I try not to write a negative yelp review but beware diners, this place is simply a waste of your money. And remember, if you're not happy with your experience, the manager will hide and will not speak to you. And when she does, she will say that she called the owner and the owner says there's nothing that can be done to make things right. \n\nNever again. I'd be surprised if this place is still open next time I visit NOLA.",2018-08-14,22:39:37

If you don't, then you should let the Eagles know that they're making a big mistake.\n\nEveryone deserves a second chance.  That's true.  But Michael Vick deserves a second chance to earn a living, not to make a killing.  He should be permanently banned from football.  Period.  Instead of getting paid millions of dollars to be a backup quarterback/occasional wildcat, he should be flipping burgers at the local McDonald's.  Or he could put that Virginia Tech degree to good use--oh, I forgot, he left college after his sophomore year so he could make millions in the NFL.  And he's doing a pretty good job of it, even after being convicted of multiple disgusting felonies.\n\nI have a heart, but in this horrible economy, do you think it's fair that someone who did what this guy did is making seven figures?  Sure, he did his time.  It may not have been very much time, but he served it.  I have no problem with him being a free man.  But when's the last time you applied for a job and your criminal record did not matter?  If you walked into a job interview, and your prospective boss asked you why you recently served time in prison, would it lessen your chances of getting paid millions of dollars?  Probably.\n\nAnd, yes, I know he didn't kill or torture any people.  I realize that there are people in the NFL who have killed people, and I think they shouldn't be allowed to play either.\n\nWhat Michael Vick did is indefensible.  He will have to live with it the rest of his life, but that life won't be that difficult seeing as so many people have no problem with this sociopath continuing to earn millions of dollars.\n\nWhat do most serial killers have in common?  As children, they tortured and killed animals for the pleasure of it.  It's not universal, but it's a very common characteristic among children who grow up to be murderers.  Vick isn't a murderer, but he did horrible things to dogs, and he apparently enjoyed it.  And he wasn't a child when he did these things; he was a full grown man without any need whatsoever for the money he was ""earning"" by being involved in dog-fighting.\n\nPhiladelphia has a proud sports tradition, and the followers of its teams are some of the best, most long-suffering fans out there.  But now I want the Eagles to lose in the playoffs--again.  Philly, you deserve better than this piece of work.

Here are my complaints... \n\n1. Their memberships are more expensive than most and whenever they have a price increase they don't notify you to let you know a larger amount will be coming out. \n\n2. Their beds are decent but not great. Recently I went tanning, my sole purpose was to get more color on my face for an event that I had coming up the next day. Ladies and Gents, you know how it is when you get all undressed, get your lotion on, get the radio set, grab your eye goggles and finally get in the bed. THEN of course the facials don't work. UGGGHH. So you start trying to see if there is some button you are supposed to press or knob to turn while trying to hold your goggles on so you don't get cataracts. It's not fun. It's also not fun to have to get completely redressed and go out and ask to be moved to another bed. So I just stuck it out and figured I would let the attendant know when I got out. I let her know about it and asked if there was anyway I could be refunded those ""points"" that I had to used since the whole reason I needed to go tanning that day wasn't full filled. I was shocked when I was told, in so many words, I was lying and that they wouldn't give me my points back. I have no reason to lie and I have had times the facials didn't work and I didn't say anything. But if it inconvenienced me and my future plans-then yes I think you should accommodate the customer. It's just bad customer service. \n\n3. Here we go again! Went in there this week, had an event coming up. Didn't even want to deal with the beds and the lamps not working so I was going to go and get spray tanned. On the sheet it showed a facial spray was $6. Please tell me why the attendant told me it would be $8. Then when I asked why it's different than marked she said it was actually $7. What the h***!? Shouldn't it be the price on the list of all of your pricing. And if it's an error on your part, fix the pricing or give it to me for what it says it should be. \n\n4. NO mirrors! Hello!?? We are getting undressed and redressed. I want to make sure I look okay when I walk out of the room. Please spend $6 and put a mirror in each room. Thanks. \n\nAfter this past month of being constantly frustrated, I'm going to be canceling my membership and taking my business somewhere else. PEACE OUT!",2010-10-21,15:26:05

He handed me a paper with a charge of $46 on it and told me to sign it. I understand that you're using their techs' time to check out your car's issues, but I've never had to sign off on a preemptive charge. Whatever though, I guess it's understandable. Should have left there though and refused it.\nEven though it wasn't a killer walk (maybe a little over a mile), I was offered a ride home and decided to take it. However, I wasn't told that the guy was going 5 miles in the wrong direction FIRST before dropping me off, then winding through a speed bumpy trailer park. Walking would have been a little bit longer in time, but not by much.\nAbout 4 hours later, I got a call from them regarding the work. The work I had requested was done but they had other issues for me: CV boot replacement and that I had to ""clean"" the bottom of the car. Total cost for the CV boots was about $430 for parts and labor, this on top of the approximately $90 I paid to resolve the issues I brought it in for, plus that $46 charge that I originally signed off on. I balked and said I would just pick it up and think about it, because they said they had to order a part from Phoenix to fix it anyway.\nSo I brought the car back home. A few minutes later, Buck's calls me again: the tech had left his flashlight in my car and they wanted it back. They also said that the shield had been left off but they would put that back in when I brought it back. Sure enough, I look inside, and the plastic shield between the center console and passenger floor is off and laying on the floor. It took me just a couple of seconds to snap it back on, but why the hell leave it off? I don't understand that one. The flashlight wasn't in there either, so I don't know what was going on there.\nThe kicker though was that I took it to my repair place the next day (place that I trust) and had them look at the CV boots. Initially they told me $89.95 over the phone but, after looking at the work, they wanted $218 total because there was more labor involved. So, essentially, I paid half of what Buck's wanted for the exact same work.\nAnd I got a look at the bottom of the car that they wanted to clean: I don't see it. It's dirty down there but, shit, it's the bottom of a car. Nothing that would impede anything.\n\nLesson here is ALWAYS shop around. I called 4 different places before taking it in to my place. Most are willing to give you a rough estimate if you know exactly what's wrong but, of course, they won't know exactly how much until they actually see it. But I would say leave Buck's off of that call list.",2010-06-17,16:40:31

Apparently worse than it was must be a 1-star.\n\nI feel bad for the manager of this theatre. My brothers and I rushed here on a Friday night to catch a movie that was sold out somewhere else. The movie had just come out, but we really wanted to see it. So we risked it. And, folks, it was NOT worth the risk. \n\nSure, the floor is clean enough, people working concessions are on top of their jobs, and the manager was polite, present, and wearing a suit. Impressive. \n\nBut that does little to combat other factors. Like 3 police officers present. Or a theatre full of dullards who shout, chatter, and Narrate The Plot during an entire movie. These people, the majority of whom were over 18, were the epitome of a bad theatre-going experience. We weren't there for a comedy or on a night many days after the movie had been in theatres. Ghetto really, sadly, describes the atmosphere. \n\nHalfway through, after paying $14 for a ticket, I opted to sit through the rest of the movie with my fingers plugging my ears so that at least I couldn't hear *what* everyone around me was saying. Unfortunately, I could still hear a couple choice loudmouths. And this wasn't the type of audience to whom you could politely or otherwise say Excuse me, please hush. \n\nAdditionally, there's a special for 2 medium soft drinks and a whatever-size popcorn. It costs $18.50 and the ""medium"" soda is just shy of super-size. Yuck. \n\nWe should have gotten our money back. We really, really should have demanded it back. I've often encountered somewhat obnoxious audiences at this Regal, but this was mind-blowing. \n\nNever again.",2013-06-13,02:52:11

I have written dozens of Victorian Chick blogs about this complex where I spent ten most horrifying, depressed years of my life. My graduate school debacle can't be blamed on Hope Gardens, aka Death Gardens, any  more than 9/11 (which I spent in this apartment), but certainly living her during both did not give me a fighting chance. \n\nI view the following as a public service announcement to fellow Yelpers even ""thinking* about renting here. \n\nNow, I moved out in 2006. So who knows who's running the shop now. But a nice old man owned it years ago. Then his mean Manhattan real estate mogul daughter took it over. \n\nThe new paint looks like a baby's diaper with light-colored loose stool. I suppose technically it's ""sand,"" but here's a newsflash: SB ISN'T ARIZONA. In Scottsdale, you see this kind of color scheme but that's a *desert* for the love of God. \n\nNow, this ONE star is for a one-bedroom on Hope Ave itself. If you live on the indie courtyard, it will be far quieter and cooler. \n\nBut living *on* Hope Avenue is masochistic unless you're deaf. Of course when I moved in, it was a de-facto convalescent home, so presumably half the tenants were deaf or getting there. I was one of the few people under 50 and one of only two or three graduate students. \n\nIt was big for the money. But you get what you pay for. I don't like Upper State. At all. It's just a funky, weird, depressing part of town. La Cumbre is even worse and more depressing, but that's like saying it's better to lose a leg in a car wreck than a bike crash. They both suck. \n\nYou have NO concept how loud the trucks are up Hope Ave. Six days a week it seems. The only quiet day is Sunday. Come Monday, it feels like you returned to prison after a 24-hour reprieve. As if the big rigs barreling up Hope Ave to Foothill weren't enough, you have THREE major banks on the corner of Hope and State (Wells Fargo, B of A, and Montecito Bank and Trust). (The sign says ""scenic"" route but I have no clue what that means as Foothill is hardly ""scenic"" and believe me, this is some official truck route). Of course no one prepares you for the noise because they want to rent the unit.\n\nBut wait, there's more! I was sweating and showering constantly from May 1st to Oct 15th because the units on Hope Ave have sliding glass doors in the living room and large windows in the bedroom with *afternoon sun*. This is a big issue with SB apartments, given the lack of a/c: does it have afternoon sun or afternoon shade. And I'm describing a downstairs unit.\n\nIf you live upstairs, you might as well move to Texas, except that in Texas everyone-not just the 1% as in Santa Barbara--has air conditioning because it's simply an inhumane and uncivilized place to live four or so months a year. Same with Arizona. You have to have a/c. And they won't let you put in a window unit, at least they wouldn't when I lived there. \n\nWell, Hope Gardens is just like Texas or Arizona four or five months a year with the heat beating down on the glass--minus the a/c. Back in the late 1990s, portable a/c units didn't work. I bought three and the only thing I accomplished was staining the hideous light brown carpet they didn't replace because a childhood friend was at Oxford and I was simply taking over the lease. \n\nNow, the pool is okay. It's all really old people but that's cool. This is SB, for the newly wed and nearly dead. But I took to wearing earplugs 24/7 for five years. This made it impossible for me to go even to Lazy Acres or CVS without plugs in my ears. If you go this route, please learn from my experience. You will get ear infections unless you wash them regularly (earplugs aren't meant for 24/7/365) or buy a few dozen pairs and rotate. \n\nAlso know that the gardeners work on Thursdays (or one weekday) and with all that grass, you're listening to a cacophony of lawnmowers and hedge trimmers. If you're on the front like I was, you also have tree trimming to look forward to once a year. This is like Fargo without the buffets. \n\nI suppose a 9 to 5 worker will not notice this. And the traffic noise dies down by 7 or 8. \n\nI recommend drinking heavily the first two weeks of January because it's better than jumping off a building in despair that Christmas break is over, the only 10 days a year you can hear yourself think. \n\nI once read a review for a community college in Texas: ""Go here only if you have no other options in life."" That's all I can say. If you have no options in Santa Barbara except Hope Gardens, it's God or the universe telling you NOT TO LIVE HERE.",2014-04-02,22:50:43

The SB Brewing Company which we love but don't go frequently (he sometimes goes for lunch as their chili is outstanding and not expensive, making for a good lunch for 8 bucks plus an iced tea and tip) was open but then we passed Something's Fishy. \n\nI went all the time in high school and college to the Malibu location on PCH. My friends and I would go for sushi and sake and they never carded us which is a real plus when you're underage. \n\nThe hibachi looks great and it's very reasonably priced.  However, the sushi is subpar, mediocre at best \n\nThere is a perennial ""happy hour"": 7 days a week, no time limitations. \n\nIf everything is always happy hour--half price--then it ain't happy hour; it's just cheap. \n\nThe salmon was bad and we sent it back. The sushi chef is very affable and it's not his fault the fish is so so. The mackerel was by far the best, the octopus not so hot. I didn't mind the tuna but I will never eat there again for sushi. It's a warehouse which bears zero resemblance to its Malibu brother/sister restaurant. \n\nI do not know if it's the same ownership or if this is now a franchise independently owned and operated, which I suspect that it is. \n\nIt's cheap: this is the best you can say for it. And the service is just fine. \n\nThe cooked food looked quite good and they do have a large filet mignon and lobster special for 34.95, which if the lobster tastes good, is not bad. \n\nThe bargain is the ramen and it looked fine but I didn't taste it. \n\nI think it is a THREE STAR for the cooked food/Hibachi and a 1-2 star for the sushi.\n\nYou can get sushi TEN times better at Whole Foods, Gelsons or Lazy Acres, which a few years ago created a sushi section with delicacies like Ikura.

The place is small, crowded, and unorganized. Nobody greeted me, smiled at me, or even acknowledged when I came in through the door. I stood there for a few seconds and actually had to shout ""Hello"" not once but twice until somebody noticed me. The crazy thing about that experience was that there was a receptionist behind the desk and a man standing about three feet away from me yet I, the only customer, had to shout out more than once for attention. I was appalled.\n\nI brought a pair of jeggings in because the zipper was broken. The man who was helping me, whom I assume is Lee, took it in and told me to come back in six days which I wasn't too fond of either. I have an alterations lady I go to back at home which usually completes bigger projects from me in only a few days. Here's the scary part - he charged me $29. $29 to fix a zipper on a pair of jeggings?! The jeggings I bought were from Nordstrom and weren't very expensive to begin with so for a few more dollars I could've bought a brand new pair. Ridiculous. At my other alterations place I would've been charged at most $10 for quicker service too. \n\nFinally, after I told my boyfriend how much Lee's Tailoring charged me to repair a zipper, he convinced me to go back and get a refund because the price was just crazy.\n\nThe receptionist, I think her name's Martha or something along those lines, was very quiet, aloof, and did nothing whatsoever to help me. She barely made eye contact with me.

Thank goodness this was a twofer deal and I didn't spend any more money than I needed to. \n\nI called the other week, knowing the Groupon was about to expire, to make an appointment. The male who answered asked me to call back the next day because he ""couldn't make appointments."" Why the eff are you answering the phone then, during the time the website states ""appointments only"" (Tuesdays, 10am-3pm)?\n\nI called back the next day, talked to a receptionist, and ended up playing phone tag with her. I told her my husband also had a Groupon and wanted to  use it as well. For some reason it was too difficult to look at the calendar and give me available dates; she would always say ""Let me check and call you back."" She didn't call back, so I called back on Thursday to follow up. Same thing: ""let me check and call you back."" Come on, man!\n\nWell, life got in the way and I had to call back today to follow up, since I never heard back from the first lady. Another gal answered, and I don't know if she was in training or what, but after giving her a couple of available dates, I heard whispering about ""she wants to use the second half of her Groupon"" and another lady was put on the phone (making her the fourth person I tried to speak to).\n\nThe fourth lady was basically giving me the runaround as well. ""We don't have anything available; can you come in earlier?"" Uh, no I cannot come in in the middle of the work day! I explained to her what happened last week and she didn't give a crap. She asked if my husband and I would be willing to come in on different days (yes), and then asked if we were available today (no-- sorry, made plans already). After the third or fourth time she put me on hold, I got frustrated and hung up. FORGET THIS PLACE! They are totally disorganized and have horrible customer service, unless it's your first time and they're trying to make a good impression.

Take down the big wooden sign that says you serve only vegetarian food ASAP. Take it off your web site. It's false advertising. I had a terrible stomach ache on Monday after eating your food and now I know why. I don't recall any signs that said fish was in the food, but I know they still today have the contradictory huge wooden vegetarian sign up!!\n\nWhen we told the very nice woman at the counter that we could not eat the food she took it away quickly without an issue and was very apologetic. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt me and my friend, but someone should be actively telling people. A ton of your long time clients do not eat animals and loved that they didn't ever have to question dining at your cafe. Oddly, she said she was trying to figure it out if we were veg. Maybe I should lose 30 lbs and wear tie dye mandala shirts so I don't get fed fish anymore hah, ugh. Can't go by that, just please start telling people when you greet them so they don't get sick/angry.\n\nFor years I've always go out of my way to shop at Essene instead of whole foods or other grocers.

I figured this would be easy enough and volunteered to place the order. The arrangement itself was quite modest but a hefty $57 plus $12 for delivery. I applied a $5 coupon so it came out to $64.\n\nThe bouquet was delivered directly to the admin staff on Wednesday, April 24. I briefly saw the impressive arrangement on the desk at reception, went off to class, and when I came back a couple of hours later, only the ""thank you"" balloons were left. I was a little disappointed that there were none left for me to try, but happily wrote a glowing review on Yelp.\n\nTwo days later, the association chair asked me if I knew that the fruit was still in the refrigerator in the break room. I went to check it out, and sure enough it was there, evidently re-wrapped with a few pieces missing. Very strange! On my way home, I made a point of saying goodbye to one of the office staff, and reminded her with a smile to not forget to take the fruit bouquet home with her. She smiled back and said she would. \n\nI had to come in the following day, a Saturday, and sure enough the arrangement was still in the refrigerator. By that point the fruit was visibly rotten and certainly inedible. The next week I did some snooping around and learned that the staff had tried some of the fruit but it was bad, only they didn't have the heart to tell us.\n\nI contacted Edible Arrangements via their website, explained what had happened, and asked if they would make it right. I received a call from one of their representatives, and he offered to either send a replacement or provide a refund, less the delivery fee and 30%. I opted for the refund.\n\nThe same day, the business owner responded to my (then positive) review, thanking me. Had they not responded, I would have just edited the review and knocked down the star rating, but their response would have looked really odd in light of a bad review so I decided to just delete it and post a new review after the refund kicked in. \n\nAnd here's where it gets ridiculous.\n\nLater in the week, I checked my statement and noticed a refund of $17.10 from Edible Arrangements. If you're following along, the refund was supposed to be 70% of the cost of the bouquet alone (not delivery), which was $52 (after my $5 coupon), so the refund should have been $36.40. I sent a follow-up email to Edible Arrangements, and they responded telling me that in light of my positive Yelp review (which, they noted, I deleted), I should never have received any refund in the first place, and that as far as they are concerned the case is closed.\n\nI replied clarifying what had happened, including the fact that I was going to be reimbursed from the grad student association funds anyway, so it's not as though I had anything to gain personally from a refund. Still, six days later, no response, no refund.\n\nSo here's your review back, Edible Arrangements. I hope you're happy.\n\nEDIT: And for some fun reason, the business comment re-applied to this review automatically. Doesn't it look weird?\n\n(And here it is in case it's removed, so my edit makes sense: ""Thanks for the wonderful response .....We pride ourselves with great service !!!!!!

Not something that would cost you $20. Maybe $10 for a really good bowl. Here's what went wrong...\n\n#1: The sunomono appetizer was made with strong vinegar - like a Heinz maybe - instead of a lighter rice vinegar. Way too strong and sour. I guess it's okay that the cucumber was not the Japanese gherkin-like ones, but it should have been cut slightly thicker to retain crispness.\n\n#2: When I order green tea, I expect at least Ito-En quality loose sencha, not genmaicha. This is a minor red flag when a place that serves Japanese food can't even get it's tea right.\n\n#3: Chirashizushi is served in a bowl, with the sashimi and garnishes on top. This is so that the warm rice (not hot, not cold) stays warm longer.

It was prettily arranged over the rice, but still amazingly stingy.\n\n#5: The sashimi was a standard selection of 4 fish and shrimp. Some of the fish looked old and slightly dry - *not* a good sign at a sashimi place.\n\n#6: I felt sick to my stomach not 5 minutes after leaving, so instead of relaxing at the coffee shop I had to rush home in case I lost it.\n\nI suppose it's my fault for going to a Singapore restaurant for Japanese food. Who *does* that? Sadly, my first choice - Ta-Ke - had apparently shut its doors for good and I had to make a last minute choice.\n\nOther things that made the experience feel stingy and unauthentic: Tea was served in a really large mug with a handle. Chopsticks were the reusable wooden variety instead of disposable, and badly chipped. Ick. Waitress didn't once come back to inquire about my needs or offer more tea, even though I was only one of two customers at the time.\nAdmittedly, their other dishes might be better - so please only consider this a review of their sashimi/sushi. Still, I can't say I'd give them a second try. Sorry.",2011-07-09,21:40:31

In general, they are very unprofessional and terrible with customer service and communication. First of all, they don't call you back. Leave as many voicemails as you want (if the mailbox isn't full), and give them your phone number, but don't count on a call back, even after the work is done and your car is ready to go. I've had this happen on multiple occasions when I've had my car serviced here. Secondly, the owner has a very short fuse and a bad temper. The last time I was there I witnessed him scream and yell inside one of the bays (when a repair wasn't going well) and then kick the metal garage door in anger. He'll also jump down your throat the instant you question something he says, inquire about why a repair is taking a long time or simply try to talk to him while he's busy. He seems too high strung and impatient to be in this business. If you get him on a good day, he can be really nice and helpful, but I noticed since they moved to this location, and are more busy now because of it, that he's a lot more on edge. I would also question this shop's quality of work, as the last time I had my car in there, I left the shop with another problem (that wasn't a problem before I went in), but I refuse to take the car back given the above issues, so I am currently seeking out a new shop to have my car repaired. The only thing this shop has going for it is a cheap hourly labor rate (which the owner is quick to point out as a bargaining chip if you question the work they do); otherwise I would highly recommend seeking out another shop to have your vehicle serviced.",2010-01-11,16:06:45

But the story continues\n\nOur dinner felt like we were in the middle of a domestic dispute.  The poor waiter guy was the only person on, and he was constantly in heated, loud yelling arguments with ""Fatima"", the chef (and I presume his wife) upstairs in the kitchen.  At least the arguments were in French (how authentic!)\n\nAnyhow, the table next to us ordered a crepe that normally included cheese.  The woman specifically said ""I'm allergic to cheese"" and requested it be left off.  \n\nwhen he delivered the crepe  the woman said ""I'm sorry, but this still has cheese in it.""  He took the plate upstairs, where there was Armageddon in the kitchen.  I took a little french in high school, and I could make out the following:\n\nserver:  Fatima, I forgot to say she was allergic to cheese\n\nFatima:  I don't care, they still have to pay for it\n\nand various iterations of that until the server came down, shame faced, and tried to give the cheese crepe back to the woman who would obviously have health issues if she ate it.  \n\nTHEY MADE HER PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT CREPE BECAUSE THEY SCREWED UP!! inexcusable\n\ni feel bad because the server was having an awful tme (and this kitchen dispute took, no joke, 10 minutes and everyone in the place was silent and uncomfortable for the next 30).

His drink came out okay, my martini was green. I apologized to the server. I explained myself. I bartend. I drink, a lot. My martini really shouldn't be this salty or this shade. He apologized and took it back. After quite sometime (I am in the industry... I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand. Of course, I didn't care what liquor was used, but it dawned on me that the bartender was initially short on Grey Goose, and tried to cover it up with olive juice.

We tell him that we're not really interested in eating a medium-well done steak, and prefer it to be medium-rare to rare. It is at this point that he tell us that we are incorrect; the steak is medium-rare. Then he opens the box and shows us the steak, cut in half, grey in the middle. ""See, it's definitely  pink."" \n\nWe say not a word. We couldn't. We were so dumbfounded. I suppose, since we're in our mid-20's, he thought he could pull a fast one.

Then everyone takes a bite and spits the cupcakes out all at the same time. It was crazy. The cupcakes tasted HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn't believe it. \nSo I tried to call and speak to a manager and she wasn't there. The employee had no clue when the mgr would come in.

She left and reappeared ten minutes later.  Here's the funny part.  What she brought back was a plate with maybe a quarter cup more of spinach on it, which she sat down on the table and left without saying a word.\n\nMy wife was disgusted at that point and we just decided to leave.

She didn't seem to remember our previous conversation so I reminded her that I was growing my hair out and had been in not long ago, just needed the ends cleaned up. She proceeded to cut off about 4 inches with no explanation, and I later discovered at home that there was a huge chunk in the back cut another 4 inches shorter than everything else.  I spent most of  a year with my hair up trying to hide this. I did not go back for a fix because I don't trust that stylist, would never want her to touch my hair again, and honestly the only fix I can think of would have been to cut everything else to match the shortest chunk, which I didn't want.

We all have heard it: we don't want to welcome too many big name stores that monopolize smaller businesses, but when was it OK for a store like Kmart to dip into the negatives in terms of customer service? I wish I could shop elsewhere, somewhere to get the miscellaneous cleaning supplies and pillows at $6, but there isn't. Instead, I'm waiting around for 20 minutes in a department that customer service has sent me to to get ""service."" I've never been a fan of this Kmart, but here's my latest gripe:\n\nI decided to buy a bike. I went to Kmart and picked out the only women's beach cruiser available, a red one. No one to assist me, I hauled it off the rack and took it to the front  to have it rang up. After waiting for years for the next available clerk, I finally paid and took it outside and went for a little ride, thinking I'd ride it home. As I was walking it across the intersection, I realized that there was a screw that was missing and the cover for the chain was loose and making noise. I turned around and went back to the Kmart Customer Service. They sent me to get a new one at the sporting goods department where I was suppose to meet a sales associate. I waited...and waited. A nice man approached me who also had a question for a sales associate, and we waited together. *tick tick, feet tap*. No one. The man goes into the employee area and finally get someone, but unfortunately he couldn't help us so he phoned the customer service desk for assistance. Finally, we see two people come towards the back, turns out, they weren't there to assist us, just walkin' on by. A sales associate finally came to help us after we flagged him down and he told me there was nothing I could do. No one could fix the bike and because they didn't have another one, I was sh*t out of luck. I could return it and come back later when they had more. I told them there were several others that were MEN'S bike, and the nice man told him that HE will fix it for me if he could get a bolt from one of those numerous bikes, but the sales person refused, stating that it couldn't be done, ""then another customer will have the same problem."" WHAT OTHER CUSTOMER?!!? Ok, guy, seriously, there are a gazillion other men's bike, but this is the ONLY women's bike! The girl associate who was with him told me that there was someone who came on Tuesdays to fix bikes, and I could take mine home and bring it back on Tuesday to be fixed, ONLY if I purchased the WARRANTY for an additional $13.99. WHY would I purchase a warranty so Kmart can fix a bike that they sold me damaged?! That's ridiculous!\n\nTo recap on the horror that is Kmart: They don't stand behind their products, the lines will wrap around the store before some high school kid will come out and ring up the next customer, and you can depend on waiting for ""service""  for ridiculous amounts of time. The people there disregard their customers and the place smells terrible. No need for sanitation, clearly. \n\nCan we PLEASE all gain a little perspective and consider another store??",2009-03-17,21:41:18

Evidently, he didn't get one of the mattresses plugged back up, because it slowly deflated over night. What an absolute crap hole. We had seen online that it was recently renovated- hahaha.

My mom ordered some beef dish (don't remember, it's been awhile) and a family friend who isn't anywhere near as picky as mom ordered the same thing. They agreed that an old tennis shoe would've been tastier. My dish was just forgettable...so much so, I don't even recall what I had (other than it had shrimp). What I do remember is that the whole reason I wanted to go here was for plantains, and I was not advised that those were 86'd. My plate arrived with a paltry chip substitute where the plantains should have been. Not cool! \nWhen my mother's almost full plate was given back to the server and the owner came over to scope out the situation, he was mildly argumentative, but then gave my mom 1/2 off on the dish she had eaten 1/8 of...never impressed with that kind of remedy when the food sucks. Maybe I'm spoiled, but the Cuban food I'm used to (from Los Angeles) was infinitely superior.\nSo, if anyone else is looking for great plantains, I suggest a trip to Ramsi's or Mayan Cafe in Louisville.

I have a deep and abiding love of all things vintage and revere pretty much anything old...but you couldn't pay me to go back to this place! There are far too many other great vintage shops in St. Louis that offer just as good or better quality and pricing, without the godawful crappy attitude. This was hands-down the worst experience I have ever had in a vintage store. The owner and her seamstress/ shop worker were equally rude to everyone who entered the store. I was there for about 2 hours, thoroughly looking over all the stock for sale and then also had to wait for a dressing room for awhile. \nWhen I advised the owner that one of the dresses had a hole and the zipper was stuck, she seemed affronted I would mention it: ""Well for a $32 dress, I'm not fixing it.""  I just thought she might want to know since she had a seamstress working there. Then, I picked up a pair of dress clips that had a price tag on one of the pair. When I went to pay, she said that it wasn't one price for both. This is like pricing earrings individually. And who has ever heard of someone going UP on the price at checkout? \nWhen a woman trying 60s dresses on asked if they had another dress in the same style, the owner sneered: ""You've seen everything!"" I exchanged a roll of the eyes with said tryer-on's friend. She treated everyone like a suspect and just oozed a negativity that I would defy the happy-go-luckiest of people to rise above. It's really too bad because there were a few decent pieces to be had and I was initially impressed that all items were marked with measurements, even if prices were on the high end. Pay more and get this sh*tty attitude? Uh, no thanks! \nI feel really sorry for this woman that she is so miserable.

He immediately said ""You asked for soft!"" while slapping his leg and rolling his eyes, again hurrying off to the kitchen to get the order amended.

From beginning to end, our stay at Gaylord Opryland a nonstop shit show.\n\nIt all started when we pulled onto the property at 2:00 in the afternoon on a Monday, only to sit in the car for 40 minutes waiting to get to the valet station.  When I inquired (rather good naturedly) why it took so long to valet the car, the valet quite smugly laughed in my face and said, ""this is a 3,000 room hotel - 40 minutes is a short wait around here.""\n\nHe was right, because over the course of my stay we waited in line an average of 55 minutes each time we attempted to valet the car.  And since valet was the only handicapped parking option, and the self-park parking lots were a zoo from their ICE and SNOW exhibits, this colossal waste of time remained our only parking option.\n\nBut the lines didn't stop at the valet station: 25 minutes of sitting at the bar at The Falls to get the attention of the attitude-encumbered bartender, who didn't know what a Hot Toddy was, didn't know bourbon was whiskey, and when another patron asked if the bar carried limoncello, made a face as if someone had broken wind and said, ""I've never heard of THAT.""\n\nAnd there was that time a maid, without waiting for a response to her brief knock, walked into our room at a MOST inopportune time.  You'd think she would apologize, turn around and leave immediately, but instead she WALKED INTO THE BATHROOM over our shouts of disapproval to do lord-knows-what before finally leaving (sans apology).\n\nOne evening we had the valet pull our car around but after 25 minutes of waiting we went back inside, so we weren't there when the valet arrived with the car.  So he locked the doors, put the keys in his pocket, and promptly walked off.  We stood in front of our locked car for over half an hour while the valet staff scrambled to find out keys.\nThere was also the time we waited in line, outside in the cold, for 45 minutes to board a shuttle for the Rockettes that was supposed to start running at 6:30, but we didn't step foot onboard until 7:15 (for a 7:30 show).  \n\nOr our final morning, when our wakeup call was a 'fire drill' demanding we evacuate the building, followed by a 30 minute 'all clear' alarm.\n\nBut the icing on the cake was when we were ready to checkout.  We called down to the valet for our car, only to be told, ""We're not accepting phone requests for vehicles, you have to stand in line curbside with your luggage in hand before we'll get your car. CLICK.""  So we finished packing our bags, lugged them downstairs ourselves, and I joined the back of the valet counter line (which stretched halfway across the hotel lobby).  Fifteen minutes later my girlfriend returned with a super friendly manager from the front desk, Brittney.  We explained the wait times, the lost keys, and the morning's phone call, and she offered to find a valet manager for us.  It took her ten minutes, but I was still only halfway through the line when she returned with the valet manager (Matt).  I explained again the wait times, lost keys, etc.  He looked annoyed, but under the eye of Brittney, took my valet ticket and offered to personally expedite our car.  He disappeared, but 45 minutes later there was still no sign of him, or our car.\n\nSo I tracked down a second valet manager, who chuckled at my inquiry and non-chalantly replied, ""yeah, Matt was looking for a white Lincoln Navigator.  I guess you're driving, like, a black car or something.  He's pulling up now, he'll be there in 30 seconds.""  He must have missed the valet tag on the key chain which clearly identified our car as a black Charger (which looks nothing like a white Navigator).   Five minutes later, my car finally arrived.  Matt's response: no apology, no reason why he hadn't come to find my over the last hour to explain the delay, just an attempt to justify the situation by giving me the whole ""looking for a white Lincoln"" story.\n\nIn the end, Brittany ended up reimbursing us for two nights and our valet charges.  However, the problems at Gaylord Opryland Hotel run far deeper than one person's experience.  Every other guest I spoke to in the lobby that morning felt the same way, and I heard stories from other guests that were far worse than mine.  The general consensus among the staff I spoke with was that this was ""just the way things are,"" and unavoidable for a hotel this large.  If that's going to be the case, I would suggest that Gaylord Opryland itself should be avoided.",2010-12-27,01:24:47

She's had issues with them, including a few poorly-trained employees and reservations without corresponding cars, but in general it's been worth the trouble. Until today, when Taylor, the location manager, threatened her with hundreds of dollars for towing and other fees after she exchanged a car with a flat for another and forgot to leave the keys.\n\nShe proceeded to a hospital appointment where she answered the rental company's call and promised to return the keys immediately after being released an hour later. Over the next hour, while being seen, Enterprise called four times, and (in her words) ""viciously threatened me to get back there right now with their keys"".\n\nTheir excruciatingly bad customer service got even worse once she returned to the lot. I'll let her continue: ""I was almost in tears. I was doing my best and practically running from my appt, still fresh from a treatment because I was so scared of what Enterprise were going to do. I had given them the option to pick up the keys from the hospital but I couldn't leave immediately as I was getting treatment. Their precious keys were so much more important than a customer's health. They couldn't wait one hour. It is pretty disgusting. I have never been so disappointed with customer service staff.""\n\nNeedless to say she's beyond disgusted, as am I. Each of my at-least-quarterly trips from San Francisco comes with a car rented for the duration.

Nobody should suffer being berated or threatened and especially not from a company to which they're paying money.\n\nEnterprise, you screwed up.",2019-02-16,04:17:39

The low reviews from the other reviewers are still valid.\n\nFrom the moment we checked in, we had a feeling that it was going to be a very interesting stay. When we entered the room, the tv and one of the lamps in the wall didn't work. It took a maintainence man flipping a switch elsewhere to make the power in the wall work. Plus the view for our room was total crap; we were directly across from a staircase. Also, while we're on the subject, you don't need a card key to get into the hotel, so any person off the street is able to walk/take the elevator up to your room. (I've never ever seen that with a hotel, but personal safety is usually a huge thing with hotels). The layout was awful as well; our sink was outside our bathroom (toliet and tub/shower) because the area I guess was too small to put everything together.\n\nThe contiental breakfast was pathetic as well; the first day was way too crowded so we hit Cracker Barrel instead. This morning my friend got up early and when he got there (about 7, when breakfast started at 6.30), they were out of bagels and milk (and everything was already touched and unwrapped). When he left, they were bringing bagels, but it was way too late.\n\nAnd after every thing, they had the nerve to try and double charge us for the room. I had called earlier in the week to make sure the reservation had gone through (we had paid via priceline). When we checked in, they asked us for a credit/debit card (we assumed to cover any additional charges), but told them we had paid via priceline. When we checked out today (2 days later), my friend had a pending charge for our stay on his account. (The woman at the counter, Dee, was very rude. She told my friend he owed for his stay and when he asked to see/keep the receipt so he could call priceline, she said no and tore it up) Since priceline had already taken the full amount out prior to our stay, the hotel is obviously trying to put one over on us.

The event was with someone I had known for some time but we never decided to take a leap into the dating realm together.  When I had first met her over a year ago, her body was of excellent conditioning and her attire absolutely flawless.  This time however, and forgive me to stating this so forwardly, she had let herself fall into a state of despair without relief that rivaled the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.  What the hell happened?!  She looked like a fullback for the Green Bay Packers squeezed into a tiny pair of pumps!  Her hair was frizzy and wild like she'd been jabbing hot electrical outlets with a fork and was wearing an extremely tight floral dress that accentuated her new girth and wrapped her up like an ancient Egyptian mummy.  There wasn't enough bourbon in Kentucky that was going to minimize that eyesore but I made the best of it and accompanied her to the event.\n\nSince the venue had not yet opened to the public and a large line had formed outside, we grabbed a drink at the nearby bar.  Now, I am definitely someone who can hold their alcohol but this warrior of a woman was something else altogether.  I think she cut through her drink in about three swigs.  I sat on my barstool watching her guzzle booze in amazement like a child at a circus watching death-defying acts, thinking to myself ""it's not possible!  No way!  The human body cannot do that!""  The way she was knocking them back, it was like throwing drinks down a well!  Thank the good Lord that shortly after we sat down, the venue opened their doors and we were allowed inside.\n\nAs we entered, my date grabbed my hand and made a mad dash to the bar for more drinks.  While she was pulling me along, I felt my hand within hers and it was horrifying, to say the least.  It felt like I was holding a large ham.  I don't mind public displays of affection but when a girl feels like she's got the strength to kill an angry lion with her bare hands, it's a bit abrasive on one's nerves.  Drink after drink she continued to pave her way through, leaving nothing behind, not even the ice, which she continued to chew so loudly, her face sounded like a rock polisher.  I was excited once the music began so that my attention could be turned toward something else instead of my Viking date.  Seriously, I was surprised she wasn't drinking out of a horn!\n\nI wish I could say that the musician was good but alas, the performance fell faster than Herman Cain's bid for the presidency.  To top it off, I found myself surrounded within a haze of bong smoke.  I kid you not, some young college students had brought an actual bong to the concert and were passing it through the crowd like a pizza at a Super Bowl party.  Struggling to watch the hippy on stage moan and howl about how the world lacks tree huggers and drum circles, my date decided to make her move.  I suddenly felt her arm snaking around my upper back.  At first, I said nothing and remained motionless, which is the correct procedure when one encounters a dangerous creature.  She proceeded to move her hand down towards my lower back and attempted to move inside my shirt.  I immediately began ducking and dodging like a prize fighter but eventually, she caught me, flung her arms around the back of my head and hung onto my neck.  Trying to support her while staying upright made me feel like I was competing in a World's Strongest Man competition.  I had to come up with an excuse to escape.  I explained to her that I needed to use the restroom and I shot away from the scene as if I had been ejected from a cannon.\n\nInside the venue's bathroom was a grisly scene!   There were drunk college students stumbling to and fro; one guy apparently passed out while standing against a urinal.  I made a dash for an empty stall and once inside, realized quickly why it was empty.  The toilet bowl was filled to the brim with feces, which seeped over the edges like French onion soup.  Also, the stall's door had no working lock and appeared as if someone had chewed it off from the inside.  Apparently, the water board had turned off the city's water supply earlier in the evening for fear of contamination from a previous event, which caused none of the venue's toilets to flush.  I struggled to relieve myself as drunks continually stumbled into the door behind me, which I held steadfastly closed with my one free hand.  Toilets had overflowed to my left and right which caused me to dance in place like Fred Astaire to avoid ruining my shoes.  \n\nWhen I finally exited the bathroom, my date grabbed me again, pulled me close to her and proceeded to attempt reaching into the front of my pants to throttle me, as if she were a Formula 1 racer, rapidly working her stick shift through the gearbox!  \n\nIt was one of the worst venues I had ever attended and quite possibly the worst date I have ever experienced.",2013-01-14,19:42:41

The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. \n\nThe second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, ""no"".  I ate else where that day. \n\nWhat I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?\n\nI understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option. \n\nDisclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity.",2012-03-31,14:52:20

I have a new restaurant listing on my No-No list. \nOur lunch today at Tin Can Tavern was a total disappointment in all categories. \n\nWe started out with chicken wings, that were rubbery and tough. It also grossed me out that I could see the yucky bumps on the chicken skin. I'm not sure, but I think they were just tossed in Frank's Hot Sauce and that was it. The Blu Cheese they served as a side, was thin and soupy. Two strikes, and we have only had our wings. \n\nThe burgers were 5 oz of over cooked beef. When we placed our order, the server started to leave the table and Brad stopped him and asked if he wanted to know the temps for them. He said don't worry they'll be fine, we wont over cook'em. Really? \nOur burgers were served well - well done. It was like eating the leather sole of your shoe. When ordering, I did not realize they top all burgers with grilled onions and bacon. I pushed mine aside, the bacon was hard and cold.\n\nSide dishes were equally as bad as the burgers and wings. My side was their House specialty Mac - n - Cheese. How they can call this rendition a ""specialty"" is beyond me. I took one bite and sit it aside. Brad took a bite and said he could not understand how a cook could taste this and say it is good to go, it tasted that heinous. Brad's side was Tater-Tots, it is kinda hard to screw up Tater Tots, but Sonic does a better job. \n\nThe service was minimal, the two men working were more interested in watching the hockey game on the TV behind the bar.  They never even took the time to do a follow-up after we were served our food. Were they busy? No, it was us and another table of three ladies only drinking beer. \n\nHell will freeze and pigs will fly before I come back to this dive bar.",2012-02-19,15:02:37

Can we do negative?  \n\nMy husband and I were looking for a mattress because we recently learned I am pregnant, and my ""bought right after college and it was all I cold afford"" mattress was not getting the job done.  \n\nWe began our search at Mattress Gallery Direct, right next to the Golf store by the Cool Springs Mall.  I really enjoyed that place.  Attentive, gave options, had us try everything he thought would work for us.  NOT PUSHY.  We found a mattress we liked, but I am the kind of gal who likes to make sure there isn't something better out there.  So we headed to Mattress Firm...and I am glad we did.  Let me explain WHY. \n\nI have never been so uncomfortable in my life.  We walk in, and immediately the store manager approaches us.  We tell him which brand of mattress we like, and ask if he has anything comparable.  He said, ""Oh, you must have come from Mattress Gallery.  Just tell me, like...what did they say about us?  We have a lot of customers that come over and tell me that they're bashing us.""  Strike 1.  (FYI - they didn't say anything.)  Then he said, ""Well, why do you like Englander?""   I said it was comfortable, plus they use it at nice hotels like the Ritz, so it's gotta be good.  He said, ""Ugh, they told you that?  That's a lie.""  And proceeded to waste 10 minutes of my husbands and my time googling The Ritz Carlton to find out which brand of mattress they use.   My bad, it was the Waldorf Astoria.  Strike 2.  Then, he saw us growing more and more uncomfortable, so he goes on a rant about how he's good at what he does, he's the owner / manager and can guarantee his lights will be on - but he can't say the same about them, and if we bring back a business card from the other store, he'll give us 40% off.  Ew.  Strike 3 and beyond.  \n\nOn top of this guys heinous behavior and complete unprofessionalism, the mattresses weren't all the great.  They didn't compare to the one we ended up getting at Mattress Gallery, that's for sure.  And the prices were WAY better at Gallery, too.

I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel), and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously, it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff, noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter, etc.  I continued to visit, however, because there's a certain sort of eclectic ""junk pile"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time, the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us, however.\n\nOne detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner, the husband (?), rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something, immediately not only made the ""tell the police to hurry up"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire, and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me, in a different area of the store, and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere, that's a little hard to digest.\n\nI'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.\n\nIf you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques, I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local, I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move, we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally, if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store, I encourage you to first be an observant ""customer"", and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all, given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices. \n\nPlease don't support this horrible store.  And in summary, it's unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow zero-star reviews.",2014-06-11,15:32:33

Turns out that would be the only thing that was enjoyable. Sadly, for a one hundred dollar meal for two, the only positive was the bread served before the meal and the poor waitress whose tips I am sure suffer for the terrible food. We arrived at 6 pm and were the only table for almost an hour - this should have told me something. We left at almost 8 and at that point there was only one other table of guests. We asked the waitress if this was normal and she sheepishly said it must be the drizzle of rain...but both Katie's and Pascale Manale's within two blocks, had guests on a waitlist outside the door and full parking lots. \n\nWe each ordered the three course offering of the day. Not one dish had anything to write home about or anything impressive. They only offer about 5 wines by the glass. Of course the one I pick - they dont have. Strike one but hey, that happens right?\n\nFirst Course:\nGumbo: Very salty. Standard thick brown roux you can get at just about any average restaurant in the city. Grade: C.\n\nGreens and Roma Tomato Salad: They forgot the tomatoes. We were the only table and they forgot one of the only three ingredients that make this salad. When we were done they brought out a sliced roma tomato on a coffee saucer with salad dressing. Really? Grade: F. \n\nSecond Course:\nPork Tenderloin with pasta and greens: Ever had dish placed in front of you and you can tell by looking at it that it isn't going to be memorable? The dish was lukewarm. The brown sauce was similar to the thin brown sauce that you can get at a Chinese restaurant. Grade: C.\n\nCatfish Courtbouillon: I *love* courtbouillon. I was hopeful even after the salad that this was going to be the redemption of this experience. Not. at. all. Living in New Orleans there are too many options for amazing food to offer inedible food. The piece of catfish was covered in what tasted like chunky ragu- only not good ragu- the taste was ""off"". The catfish was completely ""fishy"" and tasted questionable. This may be one of the three times in my life I have had to send a dish back after two bites. What puzzles me is that there are other reviews on here about the catfish being fishy. What's up with that? Grade: F- (if that were possible)\n\nReplacement dish - Grilled Chicken with potatoes. I asked for the sauce on the side in the event that somehow you could screw up grilled chicken with sauce. They couldnt even do that. The ""sauce"" which was watery with chunks of ham in it was put in a little side dish on the plate - had run over and the chicken was sitting in it. The grilled chicken was just that, a piece of grilled chicken. The potatoes were ok. I took two bites of chicken and ate two pieces of potato.  Grade: C+\n\nDessert:\nChocolate Torte: Eh. Nothing special at all. A very thin wedge of torte with a little sauce drizzled on top. It was nothing more impressive than what you could pick up at Sam's. Grade: C\nCreme Brulee: Ok. Seriously. This dish has some minimum requirements...I only found one on this dish. The caramelized sugar was perfect on top. The rest of it? Sigh. It was more the consistency of pudding that had been watered down with some ice cream. The taste would have been good if the consistency was right. Consistency kind of makes this specific dessert. Grade: C\n\nAt the end of the meal we found ourselves having to laugh at how terrible this meal was. We even debated going some place else when we left for a meal. We settled on two cups of coffee and a cookie from a local coffee shop.  I kept shaking my head and saying ""this poor waitress"". She tried to cover for the terrible food and experience....but sadly there is no way I will ever recommend this restaurant or its food to anyone.

We specifically called Franco's for a pizza because as I go through all the pizzeria's in my town I'm discovering that their pies all suck. So after reading people's reviews here on Yelp, we decided to try them out. We figured they couldn't be worse that any other we've had. Well there was potential for it to be good, but I will never know now.\n\nLet me start from beginning. We called them up, gave them our order, asked if we could pay by credit card (they said yes), they got our address and phone number from us and said it'd be 45 minutes. Now this was Thursday so I though it odd to take so long for one pie, but it was the day before New Year's Eve so maybe they were busy. They hung up and we waited. And we waited. And we waited some more. About a hour and fifteen minutes after placing our order we decided to call and see what's up. The girl on the phone told us it was out with the delivery kid, and that there were other orders before ours that he was delivering too. Okay... Now this is the part where I tell you that Franco's is 0.2 miles from my apartment. That's right, less than half a mile away...\n\nNow we're going on TWO hours and the kid calls up and says he can't find us. We couldn't have explained it any clearer, honestly, it's not a big downtown area, you can't miss us. So finally he shows up at our door with a cold pizza and asks for the money. We tell him we asked if we could pay by cc and they had said yes, so we didn't have any money on us. He told us to call them and pay, and so we did. We schmucks paid for the large cold, two hour old pie (that we should never have been charged for), told them how ridiculously long it took to get it (they didn't care), and vowed from then on, never, NEVER I say, order from Franco's Place again.

Their ""signature dish"" is the chicken & waffles. They have two varieties listed on the menu ""Southern"" or ""Traditional"". The Southern is supposed to be bone in chicken with gravy on the side, the Traditional is a waffle with white meat chicken tenders on the side. We tried to order the Southern version. I say tried because our waitress came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the Southern version. So either they were out of actual chicken or the gravy. I opted to double down and try the Traditional version. My husband switched the chipped beef waffle that had gravy so my guess is they were out of actual chicken. The waffle for mine came out with powdered sugar already on it which is not what I would have preferred but ok. The tenders were not made fresh in house and were what you would expect. None of the food was bad, but again it is not a good sign to be out of a basic ingredient for your signature dish at 7:30pm  on a Friday night. Also there are two grocery stores right next to it. Acme is across the street and Giant is on the plaza behind it. You can literally walk to either one. So to me there is really no excuse to being out of basic ingredients. It is a shame because they have clearly put a lot of money into renovating the space, but there are little details that are going to keep them from thriving - number one example is their signage outside. It is to small with dark colors making it hard to see/read when driving up the street and it is dwarfed by the signs for the adjacent businesses. Also they are paying vendors for things they should make in house to get a higher profit margin on. The best example is the ice tea. They are using fountain tea from the soda vendor (Brisk is what it taste like). Brewing tea is low cost and is usually priced at the same as soda so the profit margin is higher. These things coupled with the lack of planning with ingredients may kill their business. I wish them the best but I won't be back.",2016-08-08,16:21:55

I was enticed in by descriptions of dishes like Azteca civeche ""Pickled late-summer vegetables served on warm sopes with salsa verde"". Sounds tasty right? Wrong, it was a sloppy mess of veggies which ranged from pure vinegar to raw. The taste was nothing but sour and overly spicy. None of the veggies retained their own flavors. Moving on to the next course was only slightly better. The pumpkin & black bean empanadas were good but the black bean and the salsa negra overpowered the pumpkin. The final savory dish was terrible. The calabacitas description as follows sounds good ""Summer squash with their blossoms, vegetarian mole verde, swiss chard, pickled fennel"" but what I received was once again a sloppy mess of homogeneous textures, colors, and flavors that made me gag. This was served on a flavorless blue corn tortilla. This kind of food makes me weep for vegetarians who this chef ,obviously neither understand nor likes. Why would you serve something like this? I would be ashamed to let this out of my kitchen. Vegetarians do like flavor. At least a little salt or something. \n\nThe desserts were all average and felt like I could duplicated by getting a mix from my famous aunt Betty. The flan being the only exception, it was actually very nice. \n\nIn summary, we left discussing whether or not to stop by McD's to get some descent food on the way home. I got home and ate some tums.",2010-09-17,17:59:41

My fiance recently bought a house and intend to do $20,000-$25,000 in renovations (no joke). He loves Lowe's. Step 1 for our new house: buy a washer and dryer. Note these are not included in above-mentioned renovation estimate. So we spend close to $2K at Lowe's Maplewood on a washer, dryer, and pedestals. They only had one of the matching pedestals in stock but were able to locate another at Lowe's in Ballwin. So far, so good. \n\nDreadfully long story short: when Lowe's FINALLY showed up to deliver the washer, dryer, and one pedestal (after a painful delivery scheduling process) they were unable to install the dryer on a pedestal. \n\nI am not going to go into the gory details because they are many, but rest assured that Lowe's has failed at customer service nearly every step of the way. There were a small number of employees who were sincerely interested in helping us. The rest TOTALLY sucked. They were more interested in telling us why we should not have purchased floor models than helping us resolve our issues. (Um, hello, if you don't back up the product than don't sell it, don't blame us for buying it.)\n\nOver four weeks after purchase, the dryer is still not installed on the pedestal. What's the big deal, you ask? Spending nearly $2K and not getting exactly what we paid for.\n\nNeedless to say we've been shopping a lot at Home Depot across the street.

Don't.\n\nThis place was shady from the moment we stepped in, to the (multiple) times we walked out. To *try* to make a long story short, we were trading a car in for a new one. While we were out examining the car we were going to buy, they ran the Carfax report on the car we were trading. The man that was working with us took us back to his office, and seemed distraught, and explained he couldn't give us the deal he previously offered after seeing the Carfax - apparently the car had a salvaged title, and had all these accidents and stuff. This was news to us, as we had owned the car for the past few years and hadn't known any of this. After going over it ourselves, and matching up the dates and apparent accident information, we insisted  this was the wrong car, none of the dates matched up to when we already owned it, there were wrong cities on it - we just knew it wasn't our car. The guy insisted it was, but we made him put in the VIN again, to get a new report. Sure enough, the entire time, he had the wrong Carfax - even though he was absolutely adamant it was the correct one, that there was no way he had fat-fingered the VIN. We should have walked away after that, but we didn't.\n\nEvery single thing we tried to negotiate on, he had to go back to his manager and see if it was okay. Every time, he came back and insisted they couldn't go any lower, etc. Again, we should have walked away - but we really wanted this particular car, so we eventually ended up making a deal. Part of the deal was to get some things fixed there - but every time we went to drop the car off, there was lots of confusion about who was paying for the repair, what was being repaired - it was just a huge clusterfuck every time we went in over the course of two weeks. When we would walk in, the front desk wouldn't even greet us (not sure if it was us, or everyone - they all seemed too preoccupied playing on their phones).\n\nComparing Don Brown Chevrolet to other dealerships we have been in and bought cars from, this place was just a total disaster. They definitely have the vibe of the typical car salesmen - shady and untrustworthy.

We ordered 5lbs to sample the Traditional, Super Spicy and Sweet and Spicy Sauce, passing on the BBQ. These ""wings"" are huge! Actually, they're not wings at all but drumstick. No big deal there, it's all chicken, right?\n\nAt first look, the size grabs your attention. Upon closer inspection, the drumsticks are large but it's the ton of breading that adds the girth and also makes it hard to fit in your mouth. Tried pulling apart with 2 forks but the meat did not fall off the bone easily like when I make chicken at home. After figuring out how to eat the drumstick and removing 1/2 the batter, the chicken was Ok. The flavor, of course, is in soaked into the breading. The Spicy was hot with a good wing burn. Even the Traditional had a tiny kick with the Sweet and Spicy not worth mentioning.\n\nWe determined the Wednesday ""Wing"" Special was fair at $5/lb but no way worth the usual $8.95. We did enjoy the Single Visit salad bar with real bacon bits even for the full price of $5.95 as the ""wings"" are not considered an entrée rating the $3.95 price. Our visit was decent enough to try again, Wednesday only, especially for the price.\n\nOut third trip total and second for ""Wing"" Wednesday was not as exciting as the first. 3lbs of ""wings"" arrived, were even bigger than before with even more batter. The size made it almost impossible to fit in your mouth and the batter would fall off, causing the ""wing"" to fall to the basket. The three of us gave up and used forks and knives to get through the meal. Same as before, the meat did not want to come off the bone and with 4 of the 5 ""wings"" finished, I threw in the towel. The flavor is fine, I like the spice but the batter and chicken meat was not great.\n\nWanting to like a BBQ joint that serves up Brisket, ""Wings"" and has a decent Salad Bar was my goal. Unfortunately, Smoke 'N Barrel is not it. The food is not terrible but it's not good. The atmosphere lacks and there's no real customer service to speak of.

Of course, we went upstairs and the key didn't work.  An employee came up pretty quickly and let us into the room, telling us to call the front desk to let them we needed new keys.  After waiting on hold for quite a while we were told to come down to pick up the new keys and that we could go right to the vip desk and not wait in the regular line.   When we came back down stairs the vip line had several people in it already and the regular line was snaking around the stanchions.  The problem with this is that there were only two employees and they alternated between both lines.  We waited for about half an hour just to get our new key.  Supposedly a master key that would work for sure.  They could only give us one of these master keys which caused a huge problem since the two of us were meeting different friends for dinner.  To make a long story short, after the 5 night stay I had 5 different keys that DID NOT WORK!  One night I fell asleep sitting on the floor waiting for someone to come up to let me into my room.  \n\nMany, many others were clearly having the same problem and were voicing their complaints as we all waited in line for another key that wouldn't even work the next day.  Let me be clear that this was not a check in problem......it persisted the entire 5 day stay!\n\nOf course the workers were pleasant and apologetic but give me a break.  This is inexcusable.

It's way bigger inside than it looks, with a few separate dining rooms. Lots of murals on the wall - some a bit risque. No problem getting seated on a Friday night.\n\nThe service gets 4 stars. Our waiter was attentive. The food came out fast. Our drinks were filled. We got refills on chips and salsa. Waiter was friendly too, though he forgot the sour cream I ordered. I asked again and he got it right away.\n\nThe food, however, was lackluster. The chips were blah - no salt flavor, not warm. The salsa was flavorless. I ordered a vegetarian combo that had a bean burrito, cheese quesadilla and rice. The bean burrito's tortilla came out looking and feeling soggy, like it had been sitting under sauce for awhile. Ick. The cheese quesadilla had a weird kind of cheese, almost gummy. Way too much. No flavor. I couldn't even eat it - and who messes up a cheese quesadilla? A friend tried it and agreed on the cheese being weird. He even said it tasted like provel! THE HORROR!!! I don't think it was but it did have a similar consistency.\n\nThe strawberry margarita was a mix but ok for being that. At least something was decent.\n\nIt was cheap but I definitely left feeling dissatisfied. I am spoiled with my Milagro Mexican and rarely go to these cheap places but some can be decent.

At all.\n\nWe had a large group - probably about 14 people. First mistake. NEVER, EVER go here with a group, unless you like having to use a calculator and split the check at the end. They won't split checks ""because it's tapas"" - uh, ok. Allison B and I shared some and we each paid for a couple - it wasn't like we wanted them to split each of them in half. \n\nThis made me want to order less after I found out, so I only ordered one drink (before I found out). Several others did the same - one more thing to have to add on the calculator at the end. So we refrained. The drink I ordered was kind of unremarkable. It looked pink and was fizzy but didn't taste special.\n\nAllison and I split the broccoli, falafel, saganaki (fried cheese), tyropita (3 cheeses in phyllo) and the chickpea and feta patties.\n\nThe broccoli came in a lemony tasting sauce and was just ok for me. It wasn't cooked enough - still crunchy.\n\nThe tyropita was ok. Probably the best thing I had.\n\nThe saganaki has a cool presentation but it didn't have the crunchy outer shell I was used to and didn't taste like the others I've had at more authentic Greek places. The waitress asked if I wanted pita with it, which they charge for (but she didn't tell me that...) Of course - pita is a given.\n\nThe Feta and Chickpea cakes were gross. Bland, mushy and totally unappetizing. I didn't eat more than 1 or 2 bites.\n\nThe Falafel was the same. Super HUGE patties, totally mushy inside, no flavor. They came on a pita with feta and taziki on the side and even dousing them didn't make it better.\n\nThe service was fine. The waitress was efficient but not at all friendly. The belly dancer was there and was good.\n\nAt the end, I got out my calculator and calculated. I wrote down our totals and names so the waitress could easily match the amounts to our credit cards. And then, it got weird. The waitress told me that the amounts wouldn't work with their computer - and that every amount had to be rounded to the nearest 5 cents. So, if I owed $15.18, I would have to pay $15.20. WTF?!?! I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. And I eat out a LOT. What kind of computer does that? A totally shitty one. \n\nThe space is super cute, so much potential. But the unwillingness to cater to groups and the weird computer system, not to mention blah food, makes this place on the ""never again"" list for me.",2011-07-24,23:05:16

Coming from Las Vegas, none of the Wendy's there serves breakfast so this peaked my curiosity. \n\nSo I pull up to the speaker wondering what to get. The lady tells me I can order breakfast or burgers. A double stack at 8 in the morning? Nahhh. I wanted to play it safe so I got the Ham, Egg, and Cheese Panini combo meal with an orange juice.\n\nHere's why the Yelp rating is so low. THE DAMN SANDWICH WAS BARELY WARM! It was like everything was pre made and they just slapped it together between two slices of bread that I assume was already toasted. They probably threw it in the microwave for a few seconds. The mini potato wedges were decent. Probably would of been better if freshly cooked. The orange juice tasted like watered down sugar free orange tang.\n\nNow I know why they dont serve breakfast in other cities. It's because you guys cant even get the people in your own city to approve of it. Sorry Wendy, just stick to what you do best.

Sorry guys, but I had to give it one star to bring the rating back down to earth so that others aren't as easily steered here. \n\nFirst the positive: They do have Matouk's, which is one of my favorite hot sauces of all time. Also, the cinnamon iced tea was delicious...I would stop in and order one if I were thirsty and walking around downtown St. Skeet.\n\nTangelo's  food was pretty bad right down the line. I ordered a traditional cuban sandwich (yes, that is what I ordered - from the specials, what I actually got was the cuban sandwich they had on the menu, which I didn't even realize was ON the menu until another reviewer pointed that out...so I guess my server was as bad as the cook!) . I'm sure that the pork was marinated, but it was still pretty flavorless - just big ol' pieces of pork. To be fair, they were tender, but not even a trace of wonderful mojo flavor crossed my palate. There was also way too much pork - a good cuban sandwich is all about the balance of flavor, and all I could taste was meat, toast, and the occasional bite of cherry pepper...until I doused it in Matouk's of course....believe me, it needed the flavor. The sandwich came with rice & beans, which were completely lackluster. The beans had a bit of chopped onion on top, and I'm pretty sure the onions were only there to keep me from questioning whether they came right out of the can...these were not slow cooked or seasoned well...even the Matouk's couldn't save them. The rice was slightly overcooked. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken breast. I LOVE jerk chicken. This was not even a reasonable approximation of jerk chicken. It arrived swimming in an overly sweet ""jerk sauce,"" a side of the same lackluster rice and beans, and some mushy sweet plantain. Jerk meat is supposed to be spicy, smoky, complex in flavor, and juicy. This chicken was leathery in places and over-sauced with that sweet, nondescript sauce. The chicken couldn't be saved by Matouk's either. I'd say the chicken meal was about the quality of a prepackaged microwavable frozen meal. Overall, this meal was awful, and calling that chicken ""jerk"" should be a punishable offense. I won't be eating here again, though I am happy to stop in for a delicious cinnamon iced tea.\n\nI will hunt for proper jerk and repost to this review when I find it - Yelpers, if you are looking for good jerk, stay away from Tangelo's!",2009-11-18,02:34:24

Immediately she told me to call someone else because they don't carry a ladder with them. Lol, ok??? It should have been clear to me from that point that this contractor was going to be a waste of time but I told her there was roof access from inside the building and we moved forward. \n\nThe day of the appointment came and the door leading to the roof access had swollen from humidity -- because this is Philly and we were midway through our third heatwave of the season. Their technician ""wasn't able"" to get inside and so he left, insisting that the door was locked. There is no lock on it. I stopped by, pulled the door open and called back but Mrs. H told me that when the technicians don't have access, they leave. So she re-scheduled me for a week later. Fine. Whatever.\n\nOn the second visit, Jason Hull himself came out. He diagnosed the issue as being that whoever worked on the unit last had taken out the disconnect and put it back in the wrong way. There were no mechanical failures, according to him. He said give it a few hours, temperature should drop 2 degrees per hour or so. So we waited a full weekend. By Monday, it was still 82 degrees inside the apartment.\n\nI called American Home Shield and they re-assigned Hull's to me. I had to reach out to them multiple times as they did not call me to set anything up. Jason insisted that that he had solved the issue during his first visit and if I was still having problems, it was because the unit needed routine maintenance and cleaning. I asked him how much they charge for it and he said they don't do it unless there's a water source near the unit. Reminder: this unit is on the roof of a four-story apartment building. \n\nBy this point I was pretty sick of their shit and had my own HVAC contractor clean and maintenance the unit so Hull would stop blaming it on anything else. After the cleaning was done and the unit still wasn't working properly, I called Hull's back. It was at this point that Jason Hull continued to blame the issue on needing a cleaning and when I told him I already had that done, he told me ""well your guy didn't do it right."" \n\nSo as a quick re-cap:\nHull's misdiagnosed the issue. \nHull's then again misdiagnosed the issue without even making a trip to the property.\nHull's refused to solve the issue.\nI have the unit cleaned, and Hull continues to blame issue on cleaning/maintenance. \nHull's refuses to revisit the property. \n\nAfter our last conversation, I called American Home Shield and insisted upon another contractor as it became clear that Hull's was NOT going to help me. Before AHS could assign someone new, they needed the diagnosis of Hull's first visit. They had never sent it in. That pushed the process back another two days and when American Home Shield DID finally get ahold of the contractor to get the diagnosis, he continued to tell them that my unit needed to be cleaned. After telling AHS that I had already had this performed, they assigned a new contractor.\n\nLong story short: Stay away from this company!!!

We had a good idea of what we wanted, and one of our neighbors had recently had Empire Today at her home and had a great experience.\n\nThe guy showed up at the very, very end of the window.  He started out with the super slick ""wow, what a big, lovely home"" crap, and then it went downhill from there.  I told him what we were looking for, and he went out to get some samples for us to look at.  Nothing looked remotely like what I had just described.  He said that the first two options were their ""best selling, best quality"" carpets - but that he'd bring in some more.  He dropped another pile of samples while he went upstairs to measure.  He was literally upstairs for over 50 minutes measuring!  I'd had two other estimates done, and neither of those estimators took more than 15 minutes.  He grumbled about their ""new software"" slowing him down, but holy cow!  \n\nWhen he came back down, I physically showed him a sample of carpet that we'd already liked from another vendor.  He then began to tell me how crappy the high end Shaw carpet in my hand was, how it would never last, how no one would ever want that kind of carpet.  This is right after he'd told me that they sell tons of Shaw & Mohawk.  And what we picked out was all over every carpet store we visited.  Then he told me what a bargain he could give me on this super high end carpet he wanted to sell me.  It was even more than any of my estimates (despite being 50% off) and having a subpar warranty (though he swore it was the best warranty they offered - and wasn't so happy when I pointed out three other boards he brought into my home that showed better warranties).  And then the dollar game started...he kept dropping the price until he was close to the price we'd found on the carpets we liked.  I told him I wasn't going to pay the same amount money for carpet that wasn't what i wanted and had a lesser warranty, and then it was the ""let me call my manager.""  At this point, he'd been in our house for nearly 2 hours and I just wanted him out of our home.  I finally got him to just give me his card & go.  I'm sure that the carpet he was trying to sell me was just fine, but insulting me and a carpet manufacturer whose carpet they sell, while monopolizing my time and trying to play pricing games with me...sorry, Empire Today, I don't have time for that.  Then add a full week of 3x a day calls from Empire Today, saying that they could give me better pricing.  \n\nWe ended up buying our carpet from a local dealer - sure, I couldn't have it installed next day, but I didn't need next day service.  I got a better price with much friendlier service.  I wish we wouldn't have wasted our time letting that man in our house.",2014-12-11,14:51:34

The food and service were both abysmal. Seriously, don't go!\n\nFirst, the service was memorably, traumatically terrible. The waiter seemed either really incompetent or just really unintelligent and could not hold a conversation or say a complete sentence to save his life. He sort of told us the specials, but he gave them all 3 word descriptions like ""chicken in sauce,"" so we were left wondering what the specials really were (and he clearly had no clue). He didn't say any specials I was interested in, so I ordered the spaghetti carbonara off the standard menu. \n\nImportant side note-- my favorite, go-to item on any Italian menu, as boring as it sounds, is bolognese. I love it! However there was not a bolognese on the menu, hence why I ordered carbonara. This is important because...\n\nAbout 15 minutes after we placed our orders, a different waitress appeared to serve a large group seated next to us. She seemed slightly more talented and began describing the specials loudly enough for us to overhear. What's that I hear? Gnocchi bolognese? HE NEVER TOLD US THAT ONE! Oh, I was pissed. That is totally what I would have gotten! I've never had a waiter just straight up forget to say all the specials before, wtf. Even still, I tried to be polite and optimistically assume the carbonara would be alright...\n\nOut comes the most flavorless, pointless plate of food I have ever had. Carbonara, for those who haven't had it, is a rich pasta dish made with cheese, eggs, pancetta, garlic, and peas. It's pretty hard to make ingredients like that taste like literally nothing, and yet what was placed in front of me had zero flavor whatsoever. Just a bowl full of pointless, flavorless calories. I started drowning it in salt and pepper because I was really hungry, so in the end I essentially ate salt and pepper flavored pasta.\n\nTo boot, we started off with a couple of appetizers that sounded promising but tasted terrible -- meatballs that had no seasoning and were way overcooked, and a jersey tomato/cucumber salad in which all of the tomatoes were whitish pink. We also got a complementary basket of slightly stale, low quality bread and a dish of something described as ""veggie pesto"" (sounds delicious, right?) that once again literally tasted like nothing. Seriously, I think it was made from tofu and red food dye. We spent quite a while trying to figure out what vegetable could possibly have so little flavor, and what on earth they felt made this gloppy stuff qualify as pesto.\n\nAll in all, my date night out with the man, other than his wonderful company, was a total wash. I genuinely want my $70 back so I can take it to a place where the food and service are at least passable! Save yourself time, money, and worthless calories and go to one of the many, many other Italian BYO's in Philly.",2015-07-24,19:14:04

It's the only truck in Indy so there is a lot of hype but they are expensive for what you get. Not much meat, small tacos, and minimal flavor. I have eaten there multiple times and tried to love them to support a local startup but am not pleased enough to follow them around the city for over priced mediocre food. I recommend everyone try them once for yourself though. Indy definitely needs more food trucks and some competition for these guys to raise the bar a little! The only way to get more food trucks is for this one to flourish I suppose so I'll eat it if it's there and I had to choose between this or nothing....",2010-12-07,12:49:13

The delivery took an hour but they had said that it might take that long as I ordered at about 6pm that night.. \n\nWhen the food did arrive I was actually charged about $.50 more than the what the online total indicated. While the entrees were large and hot, the appetizers were ice cold. But that wasn't the worse part of it all.\n\nAbout 3 or 4 hours after dinner, my face and hands started to swell. So much so, that I could barely see out of my puffy eyes. In addition, I started to have stomach cramps, bloating, an extremely dry mouth, horrible headache and insomina. It eventually went away with some allergy meds and plenty of liquid and aspirin. I wasn't sure what to think of it until I started doing some research and believe I may have had an allerigic reaction to what I think was MSG in their food. There is no listing on their menu or online page that says that they don't use MSG so it's possible they do. \n\nI have never had this happen before but don't intend on going back to find out if happens again.
