My daughter likes to dance like crazy on the blue screen and it's free! \n\nThey also have a climbing structure but trouble is you have to be pretty adept at climbing to make it up to the crawling tubes so my newly two year old hasn't gotten to experience that aspect yet.\n\nThere are several rides where one token is good for two kids.  There are games here challenging for any adult to master and easy enough for a two year old to have fun. I do think they hit the nail on the head by making every game and ride exactly 1 token!
