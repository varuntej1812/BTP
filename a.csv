Pulling up to this unassuming and intimate restaurant right next to a Vons, you'll find a dim-lit and charming interior boasting incredibly creative sushi with picture-perfect presentations. \n\nLike Nicolette Sheridan, this is what we call a sure thing.\n\nFirst, the menu is huge. If you're a strict traditionalist then you'll be disappointed since their spin on sushi is quite novel; combining fish, textures and flavors in ways I had never before seen. We ordered the Surfer's roll...twice...maybe three times because every time it hit the table everyone began using their chopsticks as weapons of war. We went on to devour the Red Dragon and Montecito rolls with impatient precision. The ahi tuna appetizer is also worth noting. The sushi is served in press box form so you won't find any seaweed holding things together or impacting the overall taste. Every dish is positioned like artwork with splashes of colorful sauces striped across and as you eat and dip the image on the plate transforms. \n\nIt's not cheap but it's also completely worth the price tag. Plus, they are cool with BYOB so our feast for four ended at under $40 each. For a bonus, see if you can convince your dining companion that the HD fish screen is actually a live feed of the tank in the back kitchen.
